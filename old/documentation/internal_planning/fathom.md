Can you blur your background?

**Matthew Krasnow**Perfect.

**Will Krasnow**Perfect. I'm going to let Carolina in. Okay. Fantastic.

**Matthew Krasnow**Hey, Carolina, how's going?

**Carolina Lopez**Hi, Wayne. I'm Matthew. How's it going?

**Matthew Krasnow**Hi.

**Will Krasnow**I cannot hear you. You're on mute.

**Carolina Lopez**Thank you. Can you hear me now? Yes. Sorry.

**Will Krasnow**No worries. How was your David? Fine. Thank you. Hi Matthew.

**Matthew Krasnow**Hi. are you?

**Carolina Lopez**Fine. Thank you. It's a curious in another meeting right now, but he will join us soon. Okay. Oh. Yeah.think it's good. Yeah. Hey, Ezekiel.

**Will Krasnow**How's it going? Everything good.

**Ezequiel Molina**How are you doing? Good. Good.

**Will Krasnow**It's good to see your face. I don't think we caught you. Yeah. last time it didn't work.

**Ezequiel Molina**Yes. Yes.

**Will Krasnow**How are you doing? How is there? You're coming from a meeting fairly? Yes. Yes.

**Ezequiel Molina**was coming from another meeting. And I don't know why my internet here is working very well because in the previous meeting, I got disconnected couple of times.hopefully.

**Will Krasnow**Shins or a general perspective on it?

**Carolina Lopez**Thank you so much for sending us the documentation wheel and Matthew. I think we still have like an open question regarding the reliability of the tool.In the case of the eval up, given that ideally we would like to say something like this predict in the same way 90% of the case is done a professional score or something like that.I don't know if you have something like that. Beyond the interviews that you have conducted with the with the footprints you passed.About existing.

**Will Krasnow**um, evidence to show increase in student learning outcome from.

**Carolina Lopez**No, no regarding the, um, the coaching tool. Mm hmm. So, for example, um, they used to meet, um, the notes.To someone who can provide professional coaching advice and then compare that with the responses that you are obtaining from the, the app.And just to check how reliable are the results of the app. Mm hmm.

**Will Krasnow**Um, so. I understand. So that's what you meant by saying documents of reliability. Uh huh. Okay. So, okay, that's interesting.What are the two thoughts of that? So the reason we don't have data on that specifically is because the way our tool is designed and did you guys have a chance to play around with the tool?Because I can also show it again here today. You can tell us the other way.

**Carolina Lopez**Okay, great.

**Will Krasnow**Oh, the way that the tool is designed is not so much to replace any of the work that an evaluator is already doing, but more so take it to the next level.So we don't track a metric to say like, all right, this percent of evaluations were like correct or incorrect, because most of the time it's more of like an abstract goal that the evaluators looking to provide to the teacher.Rather, what we judge is evaluator satisfaction. So what I mean by that is often we'll have evaluators that will upload their low inference notes.I'll show you this on the tool. And then they'll get a score or an evaluation that looks something like this, and then you'll get the feedback, the growth path, and how to improve teacher growth.What we often find. and is that our users almost, I would say about 50% of the time will just edit the response.And that's not so much to say that it was correct or incorrect, but it's more to make it towards their preferences.So they'll like delete a sentence or add a sentence. But the vast majority of the time, they are getting an evaluation that is just as good as they were providing before.And it takes maybe 10 seconds to delete sentence that they normally wouldn't have included. Does that answer your question?It's just in the process of doing this. When we started, we thought of measuring, okay, this is the percent that are correct or incorrect.But for our existing users, that's just not really how they think about creating evaluations, because they still are actively involved in the process ofcoaching and evaluation. Does that make sense?

**Carolina Lopez**Yes, for example, in our case, if we are going to propose this to any government in Latin America, for sure, we are going to ask about this.Because in a way, it's an objective measure of how this is working, right? So, for example, if you are using the TCH scoring grid, for sure, we are to have the results from someone who is trained in order to apply that right?we would like to say, okay, this sub that is using this work in behind the scenes, is predicting or not in an accurate way the results from the human score.That they will just be able to do that, right?

**Will Krasnow**Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.

**Carolina Lopez**No, no, if that would be... something feasible to do? Yeah, super feasible.

**Will Krasnow**Again, it's just not the way that we, that our users care about how that's presented in that way, but that's something we could certainly do by surveying users, Matt, you want to jump in?

**Matthew Krasnow**I think we have cracked similar information from some of the users that we have that have actually given us point-by-point feedback on how the AI did versus their own personal evaluation.So one of our evaluators did it by hand by herself, and then you saw the AI and how it did it, and then compared them, which is something we have.And she consistently said throughout the report for each section, it was either correct that it gave it the same score that she did, or it was very, very close.So either within one unit of one to four, or it was correct. And sometimes a summary needed minor modifications of a few words or a sentence, sometimes none at all.Okay, perfect.

**Will Krasnow**Is there, because we would be also just happy to just quickly survey users with that specific question in mind or even do a sit down with a couple of users as well.Is there a particular, like, what would be the ideal benchmark that you guys would be looking for or the ideal kind of research that you, you would hope we would do on our tool?

**Carolina Lopez**Yeah, we would have to have evidence on, you know, a couple of hundreds of observations to say this is accurate.I don't know if you want to add something on this.

**Ezequiel Molina**Yeah, I'm sorry I took the camera off because it's not working like, even your camera is going out for me.But yeah, I think that, I mean, what you guys are doing is amazing. and I really like the app and I really like the way you've thought about it, I do think that we will get this first and over and over because at least in my experience of using AI to try to mimic, you know, to use a transcript of a classroom to assess how well the quality of the classroom interactions, sometimes work well and sometimes it didn't, so it wasn't obvious that it was always going to get it right, so I think people would be, like they would want, like I think the first thing as color was saying, we'll ask if something like that, but one of the things that we were thinkingyou know, in thinking about how we could work together is actually testing this out. Whether we could grab, you know, 200 classrooms that we have get, you know, for which we have a master called meaning something that was trained by, you know, think training got, you know, certified using the tool and then apply the tool to a video.And then grabbing the, you know, trying to check whether AI, so I guess first the previous period of training and understanding the the rubric and the like, then how it will do compared to these master coders.And then we could tell you at the end of this look, these application or can't do this, like say it has a vulnerability of 85% or whatever it is, and that's well, maybe, maybe, for example, that's well on some of the criteria, which is easier to understand through the but for some others that you need to really be watching more the video, and this is not watching the video, then it doesn't do so well.For example, I'm just saying something, you know, something that is easier to do through that than others. And I think something like that could be like a first, more of a study.I guess we did both, no, because Farti will need to figure out how to assess, you know, to train the model to assess a particular rubric, and then to.tested with with all these classrooms and then have a result on how good it does and you know the sort of thing that we have thought or done in the past again we are not a skilled AI engineer so of course it wasn't very good but the sort of thing that you can do with these things is you know you do like an authentic thing so first you have somebody that looks at the code and say like these are the codes then somebody else maybe a code then somebody like somebody else I mean in AI know AI to try to see if you get better if you get better reliability on this but but yeah I think something like this was what we were thinking to do first at first that could collaborate with you without the need of you know for government decided that they want to do it or not and thenbased on those results, think we will feel more comfortable to go to a country and say, like, oh, look, this is feasible.You could do this, you know, how we're talking about the scale and how this works, you know, because we, for this in the trial, let's say, we don't really care about the, you know, like, whether the app is, like, very seamless, leftly, and in touch of button, blah, blah, blah.But of course, the user experience would be critical for an application. But that, that I think is what we were thinking.don't know, Kara, if you want to add more.

**Carolina Lopez**You know, I think you covered the main points, I say.

**Will Krasnow**So can I just ask couple of questions to make sure it runs in same page? So this is somewhat similar to the pilot phase that was mentioned last time, right?Like, this is as opposed to going direct with government. You just say, here are people that you all have a relationship.with and would be interested in trying out the tool for us to then research how effective it is in terms of comparing to an ideal evaluation.And then once we have, all right, 95 percent of the time, 98 percent of the time, it comes up with an evaluation that's just as good or better, then move on to contracts with larger scale.Is that correct?

**Carolina Lopez**Yes, it will be like a first stage. Of course, then depending on the country, we will need some adjust on the final app.But yeah, this will be something that will help us on our side to say, look, this is a tool that works really well in this particular country in which we had this classroom of observations, and it works 95 percent of the time.Right, and in a sense, it's almost better than us doing it with our

**Will Krasnow**existing users because it's U.S.

**Carolina Lopez**It's big data system.

**Will Krasnow**Yeah, OK, And just so I understand, too, where would you source these users? If you're not going direct to a government, where who are the people?

**Ezequiel Molina**So what I was thinking is we have videos. We have two different data sources that we use for this first because we've been doing teach for a long time.We have videos from across the globe where we have done this. No, and where we work with different governments, and in each of them, we have master codes, and we have the videos to then create the transcript.But the other one that I've sorted, we have applications in a given country, and then, you know, for example, we do.in Peru at 200 videos or 196 videos from last time where we have the codes that people watching the video put based on their training and we have the videos so one could from those videos create the transcript and from the transcript analyze and then compare the results of what what would be Oh interesting so it's it's we wouldn't need to find new users we would be using data that is you already have access to exactly and we would then or you you would then right come up with the all right this is just as good or better exactly but then we we could have something to show for you know and we would have the stats of exactly you know when and if there are cases for which we can have all the behaviors so in this particular behavior it doesn't work so wellin this behavior doesn't work blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, I think we will have a much better sense of when it works, when it does.And then maybe, for example, one could review the rubric to say like the AI version of the rubric won't have the thing that we know is not reliable.So if we take it to a client, we say like, look, anything that we are taking is because we know it can be reliable.Okay, amazing.

**Will Krasnow**actually, you could see a small smile on Matt's face here because there's two reasons why I actually think this is incredible.The first is we've been working towards a similar project ourselves ready. And the second is Matt is a software engineer but his main interest is actually statistics and creating AI models.So those two things have been a fun side project that we've been doing to try and improve the evaluations that we've already beenproviding and I actually think it works super well with the existing data set that you have. Matt, you want to speak a little bit towards that?

**Matthew Krasnow**Yeah, so essentially I can share my screen but just before that, essentially what we were trying to do in this kind of project is create data or take some teachers or evaluators notes on a teacher, create the AI summary and have the evaluator evaluate how well the AI produced the output.So is the summary good? How well is the analysis? Does it properly, you know, look for whatever the evaluator is looking for?And does it give the right score? And once they've gone through that and select the right score that they think is correct, the AI then adjusts itself and then creates a new version to see let's make this better.And then we optimize so that we are continuously getting better AI and that the AI is actually tuned to the users themselves and the patterns that they provide.

**Will Krasnow**That's going to pull up is it's designed for like we have a small group of users that are like we call them the friends of Swiss score that we're close with and we give them and we very much respect their credentials to allow them to provide feedback in the system themselves.I assume Matt we'd want to reorient it slightly if we had a data set of like 200 videos or something.

**Matthew Krasnow**So just to visualize what this is is these are the notes that the evaluator would take or would be the transcript from the classroom and then the AI generates the summary.We can go through this and then the evaluator would say no I don't actually think this is basic or proficient I want to take this out I think this would be better and it shouldn't be a score it should be a three.Now they can hit save evaluation and then generate a new summary so that the AI can actually optimize itself and then go towards what the user wants and I think that really kind of it's a little more of a statistical approach but kind of captures that idea of correctness, that the evaluator has this kind of idea of what is a correct evaluation and that the AI begins to learn that intuition.

**Carolina Lopez**Okay this is great so ideally we would like to have this process conducted with all data because in theory the evaluators shouldn't have any biases right and that is something that sometimes we cannot avoid but yeah this would be great if we can optimize this data before having the final version right so yeah.Amazing, great.

**Will Krasnow**So Matt would I require any of the builds from our end to to make it work for a data set of 200 or is the system we have a currently more or less work for this case.

ACTION ITEM

**Assess project build-out w/ static data, timeline. Create project layout proposal**

> So the first of this, this isn't quite done, there's a little more optimization that we'd like to do so that it can really capture all of which the evaluators thinking and that's not quite done.
> 

> And then also we can talk about using this interface or actually the eval interface where instead of having we could actually have this built into the tool where as evaluators use it even in just a general sense as they use it it begins to learn from them and we could have that natively so that it just is always doing that even past these 200 or so evaluations.
> 

> So that will require some actual work there but it is achievable and that we have I've laid the groundwork for that already.
> 

ACTION ITEM

**Provide terms of reference & details about data for AI evaluation project**

> All right, that's great Matthew.
> 

**Ezequiel Molina**That is great. What I was going to say is that maybe after next step, maybe what we can put together is a more detailed explain like the terms of reference of what we would be thinking about.And then we can share those with you for you to either provide feedback, comments, and also get a sense of how costly this would be.So then we can move forward.

**Matthew Krasnow**Right. And I think we just partially depend on kind of what you're looking for for this. Is it something that you'd want kind of us to do?So you send us those recordings and we can generate the The AI and how to do that and have evaluators kind of look through it and then review it or is it something that we would do?

**Ezequiel Molina**kind of with evaluators in real time because Well, so I should we already have all these things evaluated So so we already have all the part that like actual people have access all these videos We now want to get the AI version of this and then to compare What are the results so so think what we would want you to do guys is, you know You will get say videos But from those videos you will need to create the transcript for those transcripts You will need to assess and then so to partner one is more like the logistic part of getting from videos to transcript and getting their own database, but then the second party is like that building the model That respond to our rubric, know, and then we can figure out a waymaybe we can give you some other videos to train the model so then you don't train with the videos that you will be using for this, especially, but I think it would be that one part is sort of making sure you can do some little trial error on getting the model right to do this and then because the issues that once you do like like we wouldn't want just because this you know we want to be a research paper you know on where we look at the on how way I can predict these measures used in transcript so we wouldn't want you to say after video 15 uh realize that there is abetter way and changing. I mean, that's great that we figure out better ways, but we just want to do that with other videos, not with the videos of the sample.So we can potentially give you sort of two data sets or within the 200 data set, we decide, I don't know, we throw 10 of them and just for to learn and then use the others just as a sample that we want the reliability.So what we would want is for you guys to create a data set that will have each of these videos and the scoring for this tool.And then we will compare and see what's come out of that. Yeah, I think that's fantastic.

**Matthew Krasnow**And that's something we can do. We can do a train test split. So we take that data, we split it into about 75% training where we get the AI to understand the behaviors and then evaluate it on the remaining 25% of the data that it has not seen so that it can properly see if it has learned the actual behaviors and what the evaluators are looking for.that is something that is certainly achievable but just require the audio transcription and then just the work of training the model.

**Ezequiel Molina**Yeah we can we can talk about that because if you use 75% to train the data I think we will have like a very small sample to look at the reliability but what we can do maybe is just take I don't know maybe like I think and we can we can check what would be the minimum number of observations that we need to make this statistically interesting forfor researchers and then try to get you another sample like you could use just to test and friend and do all of these things.

**Matthew Krasnow**Yes, so actually interestingly for that, another idea that I was working on with this particularly is the idea of generating synthetic data or data that comes, looks very much like the real data that has come from evaluators and but is actually generated by AI.So in that term, we train an AI to act as an evaluator and create this model. Yeah, that'll be pretty cool.And this is actually, you know, cutting edge AI and it's proven to work. That's how they train these models now is that they train one model just to make data and then they make another model that was actually ends up better because of the synthetic data that the first model created.And that is something that I would absolutely foresee us pursuing in this if we were to go.

**Will Krasnow**What I would imagine we would want to do, right, is take whatever the minimum number is, reserve that from the actual data, right, and then whatever we split from, like if we split it 50-50, you have this as the test data and then this other 50, you create a bunch of synthetic data, but then when you ultimately test if eval is putting out the right evaluations, it's on the actual data itself, right?

**Matthew Krasnow**And that's I think notable because even from a research perspective, we're evaluating even how well can AI create synthetic data for school data, which looks like real data, and that we can train models on because, you know, obviously the concern in education is privacy, but you, if, you know, this is a method of not actually training AI on real information, we're only training the AI, AI-generated information, so you can avoid kind of the privacy issue there training models on that.per we pull this off.

**Ezequiel Molina**Yeah, and that would be cool also because you would have the model like you could have the model that you don't use synthetic data.The model that for which you have for you, which you train it with additional synthetic data and see the reliability of those two different models to see what you gain by doing that.Because I think I agree that that would be kind of an important point to the research community. How much you can gain by doing this in the data because it does have a lot of other applications beyond classroom observations.Right.

**Matthew Krasnow**Any kind of educational data? Cool.

**Will Krasnow**Before we, I move on, I'm going to ask a couple of on technical questions, but is there any technical things related to this project that?need to be discussed more questions so in that case I just have a couple questions because I mean this we mentioned this before as well like we're super excited about a partnership with World Bank and we want to make this happen if we were to proceed with this mind of I just ask a bunch of questions just logistically that are still great great areas in my head sweet so okay thanks first is timeline so again I understand like you probably don't have exact dates in mind but what are some of the target goals like let's say without the constraints of us from a development standpoint when are you looking to have the research for from from this kind of preliminary study we're talking about when woulda pilot with the schools look like and what about the scale face and how does that align with the school system in South America?

**Carolina Lopez**The pandemic here in South America starts by March and it ends by December and that applies almost to all the countries in the region in the public system.Then regarding timeline, correct me I say if I'm wrong but I think it would be great if we can have some results at the beginning of July or something like that so it would be feasible for us to start writing the results and then we can start talking with governments about this.So that will give us like a couple of months to say oh okay this will be the country in which we are going to conduct a trial and that would be like the main paper right in which we are going to focus on teachers and then how the effects have an impact on students learning for the next academic year.

**Will Krasnow**Amazing, okay this may and the next academic year this would be starting in next March.

**Carolina Lopez**Exactly.

**Will Krasnow**Okay, so that would be March 2026. I say you want to add something to that time.

**Ezequiel Molina**You say that it would be amazing if we could have these by end of June just because our fiscal year ends in June and sometimes our codes expire meaning budget finalizing June so we can do this to at least end to have it by end ofJune, that will allow us to give us the summer to look at the start, by the paper or whatever, and then start the campaign to get countries to sign up, do something like that.I think if we can show this, we will have candidates. I'm sure that we'll want to try this out.

**Matthew Krasnow**And just from a technical perspective, all of these kind of training things happen very quickly. Since it's all computers, it's not really humans.The dev work is still sizable, but the training itself happens to happen overnight. Those are the kinds of things that I mean, I'm very much a prioritized speed kind of person and would love to get to this as soon as possible.And my point is that I want to, as soon as I could get. that data, we could begin working on training models kind of, I mean, or even working together to propose what this looks like and get as quickly as possible to start training these models and see results, see pro-marry things.

**Will Krasnow**Great. I just have more questions so you can, I don't want to do well or you work. Okay, okay.For the scale phase, let's say March 2026, I assume you of course wouldn't have a number, but a general sense of how many users are we talking about would be super helpful for us just to anticipate what it looks like from like an onboarding perspective, a customer's perspective and I presume that would grow over time and if you had any sense,of what that could look like or past partnerships that you've done as an indicator of where this could go?

**Ezequiel Molina**So I think it would be easy for us to now tell you like it would be a big, big numbers and there would be a lot of involved but I just don't want to lie to you and to be honest, we don't know, we first need to show, like say for example, we do this, show the results say 99% reliability, next day, open AI comes from like an app to do this for free to everyone and then, you know, like that will happen.So I do think that you have a lot of promise. I do think that's like, let's say what we could say.If today we have something that do this with 99% reliability I think we have a lot of countries that would want to at least pilot it in their own system to start.And usually again, we're what we would do with the pilot is start with, say, teachers or something like that or, say, with 200 schools and then show that that can work.And then, depending on the on the country, how many schools they have. But that's to give you a sense without this pilot in Lima to teach teachers on how to use AI from less on planning and all those things.And if the country could, they would scale it tomorrow to every country, to every country, to every teacher that they have.So I think, yeah, I think that the potential is big. We're working with Argentina, we have a big long we're working with Brazil, where we have a little either Argentina, Brazil are like big, big samples.But I think convincing the government is something that is not trivial. So that's why we want to have all the evidence, all the information, but even with all the evidence, we can guarantee that we will convince them to use anything.Of course, of course.

**Will Krasnow**And then in terms of convincing the government, then this might be a naive question, so I apologize. Why exactly is, if I was a government, but why would I choose to work with the World Bank as opposed to going directly to vendors themselves?Is this technology something that the World Bank is sponsoring and providing to the governments? I'm just a little bit curious about the nature of the partnership itself.

**Ezequiel Molina**The way that the World Bank gives them loans in education to do things. we give loans of like that could be high, know, to buy things like that.But if they do say, suppose that they want to go on their own and find the vendor, chances are that the opposition party will tell them that they are being corrupt, and why did this vendor are not the other, and why they didn't want with Microsoft that is bigger, and one they didn't.So, when you use the World Bank, the IDB, all the others, you go through the procurement process that is standardized, they have to show all of these things, you know, for example, data and reliability would be something that they would want to, they would need to have to hire a film.So, they could, and sometimes they go, generally, to film, but when they go to films, like countries, usually they go to big films, and because they already have a relation with them, and it's easier, and it's easier to, you know, the procurement process are pretty difficult.That makes a ton of sense.

**Will Krasnow**And then in terms of the procurement process. That is something that the World Bank goes through as opposed to EVAL or SWIFT score.Is that correct? Well, no.

**Ezequiel Molina**So, for example, if we have a loan on Brazil, you know, within that loan, decided to use EVAL. So, EVAL will have to go through the procurement process of Brazil and with the guidelines of the World Bank.But that is, yeah, so different processes. I understood.

**Will Krasnow**So, in terms of from RNs, if we were to go through the procurement process in Brazil, what would that require from our team?Is it just, I'm trying to get a sense of with each deal that is closed if there's additional lift on RN from what we need to do?Or is this something more or less handle itself as it's a standardized process as long as we were compliant and secure.

**Ezequiel Molina**I don't think it will handle by itself in any country like I think that is like a task like part of the overhead of all these films is figuring that out and then you will have to you know some rules regulations some either lawyers or whatever yeah like I again especially depending on the amount of something like that but I don't think it's trivial.

**Will Krasnow**Understood and that would be is that covered by the World Bank? Is that the World Bank's lawyers or would that be Swiss scores lawyers and Swiss score working with the governments and on that process?

**Ezequiel Molina**Yeah no the World Bank wouldn't you know be involved because the World Bank can't be involved in any negotiation between the Valam Grasil, you know, which is alone.The World Bank provides money to Grasil, but we can say to Grasil, oh, here is your vendor, because then they say that this is a conflict of the bank.So we cannot buy, say, like, look, these are these films, and then you choose which one you want to use, or they are a specific reason or whatever.Understood.

**Will Krasnow**So when we include an initial proposal, like a license to use Swiss court, that would really, it's not being paid by the World Bank, that's being paid by the government.

**Ezequiel Molina**Well, it depends, you know, like in a small pilot that, you know, we can finance a small pilot with a government government.we may have trust for money in a given country, and then we finance it, and that's it. But if it is with the government, yes, it would be, you will have to agree on theon those numbers, a government. Understood.

**Will Krasnow**And so again, just so I understand, let's say like we do this earlier preliminary study, and then we're like, all right, we're ready for the bigger study, so then we go to governments and that would be you, Ezekiel, and then essentially you would start that conversation, but it would be finished by somebody from our end in terms of the procurement process, the legal, the agreement, the pricing, and then we would then, you know, at scale, at least be licensing directly to the government.Maybe there is a World Bank loan associated with it, but that money comes directly from it. Is that correct?I'm just trying to get a sense of the legal structure of what this would look like. Yes, to be honest, I don't know exactly.

**Ezequiel Molina**all the weight would exactly work, but yes. for example, we do this, we have great results, whatever, and then, you know, we publicize the, we make people aware of the second and say, like, oh, I will have that camera.It's like, okay, okay, we can definitely adventure meeting, and they say, oh, we would want to hire them. And then if this is a World Bank loan, we will have to approve that.But there's still a whole process which you would go with them as the vendors and the value. But we are the, so we supervise the use of those resources.So we have to, so we give up through all of those things, but I'm not in the, but, but I'm not saying helping you or your lawyer, like that would be something that you,with them but we supervise that the contract makes sense and all those things and that there is no that everything is legal according to our regulations.I mean that makes sense.

**Will Krasnow**And then a question here in terms of the way I'm understanding this partnership is that all data that is in our system we can provide access to you, know, we mentioned, like putting in a portal that's that's really easy to understand so that kind of going to work with it.In terms of ownership of our software we would maintain ownership of that including any insights that come up in the process of piloting, etc.Are we on the same page about that?

**Ezequiel Molina**Yes, but just to make sure that this is something that we'll probably need to to specify in the terms of actually the way that we do this is that in the terms of reference what we would say that the deliverable is not the software the deliverable is the analysis of AI of these things so so our deliverable is getting for each of these videos and AI is calling and we will do it through your means but but you know that's for what we pay in of course and even in terms of of a partnership at scale the deliverable self is still not the software because the software goes directly to the government yeah that is a contact with the government but you know the government may say oh I want to get the yeah like that a discussion with the government I guess yes understood understood

**Will Krasnow**Do I have anything else? Okay, I guess I'm near the end of my question, so thank you for as you're getting me here.Let's say we were able to provide the data and like a refined model that's tested within earlier than June.Would this be something that could be that let's say if it was done by May, is this something that we could then talk about integrating into schools for this school year or has this kind of the procurement process of that of the 2025, 2024 school year already passed?

**Ezequiel Molina**No, I think like say we finished before then we have to do the actual study, all that is looking at the data.Suppose that we have that and suppose that you know early on would realize that this working very well. So the procurement and everything depends on country.If a country could, you know, as we work together, we will make people aware of this possibility. And then it is a process, you know, it is a process and they could potentially decide, you know, because imagine that the procurement process is not super fast.So even if they want to do it in April next year, they would definitely need to start at least six months in advance, because of what it takes.So it could be definitely different ways, you know, making these aware, some of the private schools could figure out, oh, look, this is a great tool that we could use and just talk to you guys and that would probably be much easier yeah.a faster procurement process. I understand.

**Will Krasnow**OK, amazing. This makes sense. So then in my eyes, the next step would be if Ezekiel, you could provide some kind of overview.It doesn't have to be the data just yet, but just an overview of what the data would entail. I know we discussed a lot about it, but maybe one example, like Theo, so that we could just make sure we're on the same page of what information is included.then on our end, Matt would look into what it would take to build out this project with static data and all the things we discussed, and by what timeline that could be expected.And then once we have that, then we can proceed with some kind of formative all agreement from there. Does that make sense?Yeah, that sounds good.

ACTION ITEM

**Consult legal team re: World Bank partnership agreement**

> Shout-out-out. I'm traveling tomorrow, so I may take a couple of later, but I will get back to you with this with the library.
> 

> We'll have somebody help me to get on that. Very cool.
> 

**Will Krasnow**Amazing. And then the way that I'm thinking about this too is like, you know, also just going to circle up with our legal team as well.That this would just be, we would do this in phases. So in the beginning, we could do like some high-level pilot agreement.So this would just specifically be for the testing, the early testing of it. And then if that were to go well, then we can enter a different agreement for scale and et cetera.Does that sound good?

**Ezequiel Molina**Yeah, so I will give you the terms of reference that we are thinking. could look at that and sort of think that we would agree and whatever it in those terms of reference.That'd be

**Carolina Lopez**I think that that would be. Okay. Yeah, no, that makes sense.

**Ezequiel Molina**I'm just putting when we put the terms of parents, I will put more of the links and all that, but I'm here putting the link again on teach if you in that web page.It has a section called complementary sources. On that section, we have like kind of all the training material that we use.And it has linked to some of the videos and all that. This is a global videos which we train people.I do think that there are the links there. If not, I will find out the version that has the link and send it to you because some of those things could be useful as you start to think how you would find this model.Amazing amazing. Thank you.

**Will Krasnow**Yeah, Have a look at that. That seems cool. Cool. Sounds good. We'll take a look at all of this stuff.Wait, those materials and thank you back to you. Oh, the final thing I was going to mention is that so then like our eval like the proposal we made before like that course still stands and we'll just revisit that when it comes time to actually get it into classrooms, but we're not there just yet.So we're going to consider this prologue first.

**Carolina Lopez**Yeah, it would be like the previous day.

**Ezequiel Molina**I wanted to say just because of the sort of things that we've been discussing, as in that in whichever paper we do, we will need to describe in detail what was done to generate the codes and in the discourse.So that is not the secret source, let's say, because it's not that we'll have to put the whole code, but just to say that we will have to explain exactly what we did this, because if not, people will ask.

**Matthew Krasnow**Fantastic. Yeah. I'd love to share that. I want to know. Yeah, that's something totally we want other people to know about.Cool.

**Ezequiel Molina**Awesome. Awesome. Let's get to work. I will get to work faster because I have to do the reference, but then we'll send it to you guys.Sounds great. Thank you so much for the informative call and we'll be in touch soon.

**Will Krasnow**Thank you.

**Carolina Lopez**you.

**Matthew Krasnow**Great. That was great.

**Will Krasnow**That was really good. Dude, dude, dude. I'm thinking, we'll have to see, I'm thinking 10k, that's reasonable, right? something like 10k, let's just get this done.We have to keep it in the realm of what we were talking about before. I want to up a little bit because they already gave us the indicator that it was too cheap.10k, but you're going to tell me, but before you do that, tell me how long it would really take you.

**Matthew Krasnow**You take me a few weeks.

**Will Krasnow**Okay, so I might do more.

**Matthew Krasnow**I'd say like, yeah, like I want it to be good because I want to secure the next . Right, that's important.That's really the, that's, this is, this is proving we can do it.

**Will Krasnow**And if the next was guaranteed, and of course I'd be like, well, we can, but if it's not, right?

**Matthew Krasnow**I think we could, we could shoot a little higher because it's going to take a while.

**Will Krasnow**Really, what, what is left over?

**Matthew Krasnow**So the thing I'm working on isn't done like that. Optimizing the thing isn't fully done, but it's also not like crazy hard to do what we need to do.It's like there's basically couple of things. Take their data that they give us, format it properly, then find creative ways train models based on it.

**Will Krasnow**If there was the only thing I was doing, two weeks, like I'm confused, why don't we almost have it built out?

**Matthew Krasnow**It's kind of a different set up that we use, but what if there's a manual component? We don't like that.What do you mean, manual?

**Will Krasnow**I'm just saying, what if we had an intern format for the system you already built or something? that's not a thing.

**Matthew Krasnow**It's like, I don't know, we could do something like that. Yeah. Something Jare could do if we were to take him.Absolutely. You need him no machine running is the thing. Because it's really like, oh, so then there's no manual thing.

**Will Krasnow**I meant like if the issue is like you're trying to automate how we collect from the videos or something.

**Matthew Krasnow**No, it's literally just like how well can you create a model for this. And I don't think it's that hard.It's going to be some cost in generating synthetic data. Minor and we might be able to get Google to pay for it.

**Will Krasnow**Biggest thing is like, dude, if we're taking you away for three weeks, that's actually a up.

**Matthew Krasnow**I don't think he would take three weeks. I think a real relative. Estimate would say two weeks down something.I'm really proud of How many eight hours a day five days a week. Yeah, so what is that 80 hours?Sure.

**Will Krasnow**Yeah So your time's the worst how many hours are we I mean how many how many hours now 200 died?16,000 That's pretty good.

**Matthew Krasnow**That's pretty good.

**Will Krasnow**Oh, let's think That feels reasonable We could push 20 I think 20s are sounds good.

**Matthew Krasnow**It's like also a nice number Yeah, it's no joke And I think it from a company perspective for 20k It's worth me just working for two weeks.I mean 20 You Not like great.

**Will Krasnow**That's big money for us. That puts us, you know, we're fine.

**Matthew Krasnow**You can sustain. I think if we see 20 K and they're like, yes, I would do it tomorrow. What could possibly be, I mean, I just think that's.

**Will Krasnow**And also just so tell me what can, what are you doing at Justin's? Not a lot.

**Matthew Krasnow**Justin needs, Justin will need to push and get better to do all the things that I do. But he's almost there, dude.He's getting much better. He's really good and really fast learner. Like the settings page was like, bang. It's a little more practice, because a lot of it is just like, you need to learn, you just need reps.But it's like, if I went, if I took two weeks off and was just there to help him with stuff, like help him with things that he needed, hardest tasks, yeah, we could do it.Absolutely do it. And still progress on e-vow or Swiss core. because we could say like we could get you this preliminary like we could get them a paper by May 1 I didn't want I didn't wasn't sure how ambitious you did right you did you did it right for a second I got scared you did great achieve what was the right word yeah you said I'd say it to you you said he did great you did great dude were you thinking about the a model before I saw you were you like well I was like oh wow I thought about this but then I didn't didn't connect the eyes of like oh I did this dude this is a dude that we do have that so hard man yeah that was good that was really good come on we do it that goodThat was good. That was really good. Yeah, and I think they did. They loved it. I think they really loved it.

**Will Krasnow**loved it. They loved it. Dude, was great. That was really good. Because I think we working directly with the governments, but we get to define our price, which is good.But this is no joke about the deals. thought they were doing the deals. It's not worth it. They're more so promoting it.It's like they're doing marketing, but we're closing the deals.

**Matthew Krasnow**But that's still like if you're closing a deal, it's a big deal. Right? Because they're talking about like, they were so ambitious with the numbers of like, they'll just take it.They're like, if we said we were rolling out this AI program to all of Lima, they would be like, they just sign.Yeah, they all wanted it.

**Will Krasnow**This world bang. I mean, this is something that World Bank could want to acquire us. Like I did see us working for the World Bank.You know what I mean? It's sick. It's so sick.

**Matthew Krasnow**Come on.

**Will Krasnow**Because literally, like I could see it, like just down the line, like this goes really well. We're building software and they just want us all time and we're like, yo, and before other tools or whatever, like I could see, we could potentially, or it's like, it could just be like a contract company of like, yeah, they want to like, or wants this kind of AI education tool, like boom done.Cool. That was a good call.

**Matthew Krasnow**Okay.

**Will Krasnow**That feels good because it's really left from now. Like, this is no joke, but that's a really cheap deal, you know I mean?But that's 20k will go far, man. Oh my God.

**Matthew Krasnow**They were going to stretch it like crazy. We would. I mean.

**Will Krasnow**And it's more than a year's worth of money.

**Matthew Krasnow**that's great. That's good. And you sold a YC thing. Yeah, so you're just taking time. Because I was kind of concerned because they were like, we'll get back to by the end of March.Yeah. And then they didn't. Yeah, but I'm good.

**Will Krasnow**Thank you. How's EVO going? You're just really good.

**Matthew Krasnow**Really?

**Will Krasnow**Wait, I keep on running into that issue. Are you like, is that concerning or Oh, I can check.

**Matthew Krasnow**But I mean, I'll get to it tonight. I've been testing everything locally. And like the local site looks really good.It could be just like a small bug on the live site. Oh, bad. From the testing. So, but oh, but you've been doing well.

**Will Krasnow**Like, that's not what you've been on.

**Matthew Krasnow**There's really like one thing that I am aware of that is like, difficult, and everything else is pretty easy.We're ready. We're ready.

**Will Krasnow**Oh, so I'm just like, because I was totally like.

**Matthew Krasnow**I just thought you were working on this thing like it wasn't No, I think there's an issue with this eval art investing Or like your cookies or something Oh, I see what you mean, okay, yeah, I'll fix that All right, but That's fire though, bro.

**Will Krasnow**Okay, so here's what you're gonna need to do Do your things With your back from Ezekiel, but also you could do this.I'm like Think about it All right, we need a layout of what this project would entail I'm gonna add to this.I would structure this Not like a deck And you know the English proposal in the exact form

**Will Krasnow**And then we have Sam just throw our branding on with the World Bank. Yeah.

**Matthew Krasnow**Right, I think. Or maybe not. I don't know. Yes, research proposal.

**Will Krasnow**Talk about the steps. Talk about whatever, and it won't present to them a cost for it. Bang.

**Matthew Krasnow**Yep. Think that through.

**Will Krasnow**at the resources. looks like these resources are here on the website. Do you want me to add this to your notion or do you have it?

**Matthew Krasnow**I can add it. I'm good. So is this like once evale, I'm going to do it once. Do it once evale.Cool. Thursday is still very important. You. You.

**Will Krasnow**It's so interesting about the nature of the deal. I wasn't familiar with what exactly was going on.

**Matthew Krasnow**Yeah. Word. Word. Is it cool if I don't come to design review and work on evil? This is cool.

**Will Krasnow**As long as you're fine with the decisions we may make on the website, I think that'll be fine.

**Matthew Krasnow**I'll watch the phone.

**Will Krasnow**Okay. Might be 25. I don't want to get excited.

**Matthew Krasnow**20, And what do you think of open sourcing the research? Just like I really have no issue with it because it's like just well, isn't that kind of what they already said?

**Will Krasnow**Yeah.

**Matthew Krasnow**because it's research.

**Will Krasnow**Yeah. I'm fine.

**Matthew Krasnow**I'm sorry.
