\section{Introduction}

The evaluation of classroom teaching effectiveness remains a critical challenge in educational research and practice. Traditional human-based evaluation systems, while thorough, are resource-intensive and subject to inter-rater variability. This research investigates the potential for artificial intelligence systems to provide consistent, reliable classroom observation evaluations using multimodal inputs including audio recordings and transcriptions.

The primary research questions addressed in this study are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Can AI consistently evaluate classroom observations compared to human evaluators?
    \item How do multimodal approaches compare to single-modal inputs in evaluation accuracy?
    \item Does fine-tuning on domain-specific data improve evaluation performance?
    \item Can diversified chain of thought methods enhance evaluation quality?
    \item Do synthetic data augmentation techniques boost model performance?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Phase 1: Data Preparation and Exploration}

\subsubsection{Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)}
The initial phase involves comprehensive examination of existing datasets to understand:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Data structure and format characteristics
    \item Quality metrics and completeness assessment
    \item Pattern identification and anomaly detection
    \item Documentation of limitations and constraints
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Data Cleaning and Dataset Construction}
Two distinct datasets will be constructed corresponding to TEACH1 and TEACH2 frameworks. Each dataset will contain the following standardized column structure:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Identifier}: Unique ID for each classroom evaluation/observation
    \item \textbf{Audio File 1}: First audio recording file or link
    \item \textbf{Audio File 2}: Second audio recording file or link  
    \item \textbf{Transcription 1}: Automated transcription of first audio
    \item \textbf{Transcription 2}: Automated transcription of second audio
    \item \textbf{Evaluation Columns}: All TEACH framework evaluation metrics and scores
    \item \textbf{Metadata}: Language, country of origin, and contextual information
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Audio Transcription Generation}
An automated transcription pipeline will be implemented using Whisper or alternative state-of-the-art models. This process includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Processing all audio recordings for text generation
    \item Quality validation and accuracy assessment
    \item Organized storage in accessible formats
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Phase 2: Data Splitting and Visualization}

\subsubsection{Train-Test Split}
Given the independence of evaluation observations, a random splitting approach will be employed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Optimal split percentage determination based on dataset size
    \item Balanced representation across evaluation categories
    \item Methodology documentation and rationale
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Feature Extraction and Data Visualization}
Comprehensive visualization suite creation includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Data quality and quantity visualizations
    \item Statistical summaries of evaluation scores
    \item Distribution pattern analysis across metrics
    \item Organized codebase folder structure for retrieval
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Phase 3: Model Development and Training}

\subsubsection{Base Model Pipeline Creation}
Three distinct modeling approaches will be developed:

\paragraph{Audio-Only Model} Processes raw audio recordings directly for evaluation prediction.

\paragraph{Transcript-Only Model} Analyzes text transcriptions using natural language processing techniques.

\paragraph{Multimodal Model} Combines both audio and transcript inputs through fusion architectures.

\subsubsection{Model Fine-Tuning}
Each base model will undergo domain-specific fine-tuning:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Training dataset adaptation
    \item Cross-validation hyperparameter optimization
    \item Performance comparison across modality combinations
    \item Configuration documentation
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Novel Diversified Chain of Thought Method}
A multi-agent discussion system will be implemented featuring specialized AI agents:

\begin{description}
    \item[Rhetorician Agent] Analyzes communication effectiveness and clarity
    \item[Principal Agent] Evaluates from administrative and leadership perspective
    \item[Teacher Agent] Provides pedagogical assessment and instructional quality
    \item[Student Agent] Offers learner experience and engagement viewpoint
\end{description}

The system architecture includes:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Agent group chat discussion mechanism
    \item Final evaluation synthesis AI processing all agent inputs
    \item Various system prompt and model configuration testing
    \item Fine-tuning application to ensemble approach
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Phase 4: Advanced Techniques}

\subsubsection{Synthetic Data Generation}
When time permits, synthetic data augmentation will be explored:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Random sampling of real human transcriptions
    \item AI-generated classroom evaluation transcript creation
    \item Synthetic evaluation generation using fine-tuned models
    \item Expanded training dataset creation combining real and synthetic data
    \item Performance improvement assessment on augmented datasets
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Phase 5: Model Evaluation and Analysis}

\subsubsection{Comprehensive Evaluation Suite}
Multiple evaluation metrics will be employed:

\paragraph{Inter-Rater Reliability} Cohen's kappa and related statistical measures for consistency assessment.

\paragraph{Accuracy Assessment} Alignment measurement with human evaluation standards.

\paragraph{Error Analysis} Identification of specific areas where AI performance degrades.

\paragraph{Score Proximity Analysis} Determination of AI score ranges relative to human evaluations.

\paragraph{Comparative Analysis} Performance evaluation across:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Single modal vs. multimodal approaches
    \item Base models vs. fine-tuned models
