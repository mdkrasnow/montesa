# Introduction

# BACKGROUND

This manual is intended to guide a Teach Trainer through the process of training a group of implementors or observers to become certified on the Teach classroom observation tool1. This consists of learning the purpose of the tool, all the elements and behaviors, various types of practice both in classrooms and the field, and finally the Reliability Exam which participants pass to become certified observers. This manual is organized into different parts, which should be used differently. For example, some sections are written as script to be read to participants and others are organized as directions for the trainer. As such, this introduction will serve as an outline of how the different parts of the manual should be used to successfully conduct a training.

# HOW TO USE: DAY 1 SCRIPT

The Day 1 script has been organized to provide a highly structured first day of training. Although the script is comprehensive, the trainer may adapt the script as necessary to fit their teaching style or a group’s specific needs. The slides in the manual correspond to the slides in the training power point. The slides should be changed first and then the associated text read. While the script is written in a way that the trainer can read through most of the training for the day—the trainer must still take time to read the script ahead of time, become familiar with the activities, prepare video clips, etc.

Each section has its own heading. Next to each section there is a time in brackets, for example:

WELCOME AND INTRODUCTIONS
[20 mins]

1 The World Bank recommends the optimal size of a participant group to be 20 people and this training manual has been developed for groups of a similar size. While most of the items can be

# BACKGROUND

This time is to give an estimate of how long the section should take and should help the trainer pace themselves throughout the training. These time stamps correspond to the times in the sample agenda (see the Training Package). Note that while it may be necessary to adjust and spend additional time on a section in which participants are struggling, this means to finish the training on time another area will need to be shortened. Alternatively, if one area is completed more quickly, extra time can be spent on a section participants find more challenging.

There are also tips for the trainer throughout the script. Note that italicized items in brackets are addressed directly to the trainer and are not to be read aloud. They may provide instructions for what to do, or tips for guiding discussion. Here are a few examples:

- [Let groups share what they learned]
- [Play Video]
- [Participant answers]

These should not be read aloud, but instead provide direction to the trainer. Similarly, various activities are integrated into the script in this manner. It is important for the trainer to study the manual ahead of time to ensure they have the necessary materials and understanding to conduct the various activities.

For example, there is a “game” integrated throughout the training to encourage participation and make the training a little more engaging (see Page 26 for more information). To conduct this activity, first, the trainer will need to make sure all participants have a printed scorecard from the Training Package. Participants should write their names on it and identify behaviors for each of the scenarios mentioned throughout the training. Remind the participants not to cheat and to work independently. After the last scenario (before the Socioemotional Skills video), the trainer should collect scaled, be aware that timing for questions, number of proctors for exam, etc. may vary with the size of a training cohort.

# TEACH TRAINING MANUAL

# INTRODUCTION

all the completed scorecards and score them. During the wrap-up section, small prizes (perhaps a candy bar, pen, etc.) should be awarded to the participants who achieved the most correct scores. Also consider awarding prizes for the one who improved the most throughout the training and the one who put in the most effort. If there is a tie, the trainer may consider a tie-breaking question, a simple game, such as scissors-paper-rock, or awarding prizes to both.

# Collecting & Using Data — Monitoring and Tracking

There are many ways to collect and use data throughout the training. Using a “tracker” (sample provided in the Training Package) can be an excellent tool to track participants in real time and use that information to enhance learning. As its name suggests, this is simply a tool to keep track of who is participating and in which areas participants might be struggling.

As you can see, the layout of the tracker is simple. There is a space for each participants’ name, a space for participation, a row for each element, a space for notes, and a place to record how each participant did on each of the practice videos. Before beginning the training, make sure all participants names are entered into the sheet and that the sheets are printed out. Names should be alphabetized or organized in a way that they are easy to find quickly.

During the training, keep the tracker on a clipboard so that you can walk around with it and a writing utensil. Make tick marks by names of those who participate each time they answer a question or volunteer information. Then, if you need to call on someone, consider glancing at your tracker and selecting a name of someone who hasn’t yet spoken. As the training progresses you will have more information on which to draw. For example, if during discussion of a video someone has a question on critical thinking, glance at the tracker and call on a participant who has a good grasp of the topic and ask them what they think. This is an extra way to help involve participants.

# HOW TO USE: DAY 2–5 SECTION

The Day 2-5 section has various components and is not to be completed linearly as the Day 1 Script. Here we will outline the various sections and how they are used. All sections should be thoroughly studied before beginning the training.

# Practice

A lot of practice is necessary to pass the Reliability Exam and this third section of this manual helps the trainer guide participants through different types of practice with the goal of mastering the tool and achieving certification. The types of practice provide scaffolding for the participants – for example, Practice 1 has a lot of trainer support and as the group gradually moves to Practice 4, participants are completing the entire process independently and have an opportunity for questions and to debrief at the end. Different types of practice can be used more than once. While moving from more scaffolding (Practice 1) to less scaffolding (Practice 4) helps participants learn, different orders may be considered to fit the unique needs of the participant group.

# Areas of Confusion

This section consists of additional information for each of the 10 elements. Data for this section was compiled from previous pilots of the Teach tool. As such, this provides real data about areas in which participants have been more prone to struggle; however, as pilots may have been conducted with earlier iterations of the tool, some behaviors might not have been captured.

# TIPS FOR SUCCESSFUL TRAINING

# During the Training

# Getting to Know the Participants

This includes providing a space for introductions to break the ice, learn participant names, and get to know participants' background in terms of their ideas about teaching and education. For example, in some cases it might help to have a space for them to share how they see “good teaching” and then say explicitly that there is tremendous value in those views because they come from their experiences. However, it is important to remind them that the purpose of the tool is to share a common lens to identify a specific set of good teaching practices. We all need to acknowledge our own beliefs about good teaching and then see how we can either align them with the tool or put them to the side when coding. Otherwise, reliability will be threatened. Also, asking more targeted questions to get people to talk can be an effective strategy to hear what participants think and see how their views are similar or different from the ideas reflected in the tool.

# Create a Positive Environment to Facilitate Idea Sharing

This means making people feel comfortable to share what they think by acknowledging their experiences and perspectives and using positive reinforcement by saying things like “That is an interesting idea.” Show the benefit of making errors, encouraging participants to understand that mistakes are part of the learning process. Particularly, the trainer needs to avoid getting defensive and ignoring or confronting enumerators, and instead use reflective listening by paraphrasing what people say and repeating it back to them.

# Breaking Down the Learning Process

This means developing a progressive learning process for coding practice videos by providing more support at the beginning and then decreasing such support as the training progresses. The practice section is designed in this way, with Practice 1–4 as is the Day 1 training. Particularly, this means early in the training, participants are given more support by participating in large group discussions facilitated by the trainer. As the training progresses, the trainer may gradually step back, first by allowing small group discussions in which participants share with one another, and finally where participants are able to complete tasks on their own.

# Survey

The participant survey can be found in the Training Package. Make sure to administer the survey and send the results to teach@worldbank.org to help the continual assessment of the tool.

# Reliability Exam

This section provides information for successfully conducting the Reliability Exam.

# INTRODUCTION

# Setting Expectations

Make sure to set expectations for the group at the beginning of the training. For example, perhaps it is expected that people will raise their hands to ask a question, listen when someone else is talking, turn off their phones while not on break, watch the video silently, don’t cheat/look at other people’s notes/scores, etc. Setting expectations at the beginning helps pave the way for a smooth training.

# Materials

Always check to make sure participants have the necessary materials to complete a specific activity. For example, everyone should have a training manual, score sheets, blank paper to take notes, and a writing utensil. Make sure everyone has what they need before starting each video, etc. If items such as score sheets are limited, make sure to remind participants to use one scoresheet for all the different element training videos and another for the area training videos. In this way, they should only need two scoresheets for the Day 1 training (one for the element videos and one for the area videos). If they simply need more space to take notes, encourage them to take notes on blank paper.

# Preparation

# Film videos

Try to obtain a variety of classrooms with a representative sample of videos, range of quality (Low, Medium, High). Use protocols indicated in the videographer manual. At least 20 videos and ideally 20 different classrooms.

# Editing videos

Create 15-minute segments and categorizing them in overall areas to help later selection of segments. Also, name the segments with an easily identifiable name using the name of the school, grade, and subject being taught (For example: School1_G3_Math).

# Master coding

There should be at least 3 people per video with different roles (writer, organizer, and quality controller). The organizer coordinates the date and time for the discussion, the writer takes notes during the phone call and writes the justifications, and the quality controller reviews the justifications for the master codes. First, they all code individually and after assigning scores, they have a discussion to get the master codes. In case of disagreements, master coders can watch the video again. Ideally, other master codes can review the justifications to make sure that they reflect what is on the video.

# Selecting videos for training

One short clip for each element is included in the training power point to serve as an exemplar. 6 local videos should be sourced for practice, and at least 6 videos for reliability, 8 if possible. If you do change any exemplar clips, do not use reliability videos to show examples for the short clips or for practice videos. Practice videos can include the videos used for the short clips if necessary.

# Training Packet

Multiple additional resources for the training included in the training packet. Check all materials ahead of time to familiarize yourself with them, print out necessary documents, etc. Documents included in the Training Package include:

- Sample agenda
- Power Point with video clips
- Sample practice videos
- Sample exam videos
- Game Sheet (with Scorecard)
- Quiz Item Bank
- Sample Trackers
- Reliability Excel
- Teach Certificate

# WELCOME AND INTRODUCTIONS

[20 mins]

Welcome everybody, my name is ______, I am ______ [give background of who you are and your relationship to the tool.]

Welcome to the Teach tool training! The purpose of this training is for you to understand how the tool works so that you can all pass the reliability test and become effective Teach coders for classroom observations. It is important for you to know from the start that if you don’t pass the test at the end of the training, you will not be certified to carry out Teach classroom observations.

Today, we will start off with introductions, get to know each other a little bit more, and our ideas about education. Then, we will spend most of the day studying the tool and so we may work towards coding classroom observations reliably using Teach.

This training is designed to be interactive and engaging. We’ll have lots of opportunities for participation so please be engaged and ask questions. The quality of this training really depends on your active participation!2

Note: Try to use participant names when possible throughout the training, for example when calling on volunteers to read, or referencing statements someone made. Participants should have nametags to help facilitate using names throughout the training. If there are no nametags have participants write their names on a piece of paper and put it in front of them on the table.3

Use a “tracker” to make note of who has participated, students who are struggling, etc. See the Training Package for a sample tracker. Keep the tracker on a clipboard so it is easy to move around the room with it, make tick marks by names when they participate and take notes.

# TEACH TRAINING DAY 1 SCRIPT

[The first dynamic is an ice-breaker, all participants are divided into groups of 4-5 people and are encouraged to introduce themselves, share about their background with education, and their expectations for the training. They then exchange information about themselves and find similarities within the entire group (or with one other person). Finally, each group (or person) shares about a topic they found out they had in common. Choose group or pair introductions based on the size of the group and what you think will work best.]

Now we will do the introductions, let’s make groups of 4 or 5, try to get together with people you don’t know and introduce yourselves. Please share a little bit about your background regarding education and your expectations for the training. As a group, you’ll have 5 minutes to figure out something you have in common with the other people in your group: you all love pets, or like going to yoga, it doesn’t have to be education related.

OK everybody, you may begin.

[Be prepared to help groups form if necessary. Monitor the room to see when people seem to be finished but give them roughly 5-10 minutes. Consider setting a timer everyone will hear to mark the end if deemed necessary. Note that is important to set clear expectations from the beginning and make sure you are effectively managing your time throughout the training, so you can accomplish all the tasks. Make sure you are prepared, try to minimize transition time, and keep participants on task]

Which group wants to start?

[Let groups share what they learned about one another. For example, maybe everyone likes the same food or has visited the same country/city. After everyone has finished continue…]

Thank you all for sharing about yourselves. Now that we all know one another a little bit I hope you’ll feel comfortable asking questions or making comments about things you may not understand throughout the training. We will have some small group work throughout the training so now you also know who your group is!

[Trainer should also take a moment here to set forth behavioral expectations]

# PURPOSE OF TEACH

[5 mins]

Let’s start by giving a little background on this tool. Has anyone ever used a classroom observation tool before?

[Ask for a show of hands. May also ask for volunteers to share which tool they have used if relevant]

# 2. OVERVIEW

# PURPOSE OF THE INSTRUMENT

The purpose of this tool is to help observers identify effective teaching practices and also areas for improvement. The ultimate goal of this tool is to help teachers improve teaching in a way that helps students obtain a better education.

Whether or not you have used other tools, you can successfully learn to use Teach. This tool was specifically designed to be used by people such as yourselves. You do not need to be a teacher or have any specific background or education, you simply need to complete this training and pass the Reliability Exam.4

Over the next several days, you will learn the specifics of the tool and become proficient at using it to code videos of classroom sessions. Today we will go through all the various areas and elements of the tool. Tomorrow we will continue by practicing and coding videos together so you can get a feel for actually using the tool. Next, we will have a field day to see what live observations are like.5

Then we will continue practicing for the Reliability Exam and have a discussion on how to use the tool. Finally, we will have the Reliability Exam and certification. To pass the Reliability exam, you must be “reliable” with the tool, which we’ll talk about a little bit later and I’ll explain in detail what we mean by reliable and what exactly you need to do to pass the test. First, let’s talk about how you actually use the tool to code classroom observations.

# TRAINING AGENDA

# TEACH TRAINING DAY 1 SCRIPT

# TEACH OVERVIEW

Please turn to Page 3 in the manual. As you can see, the tool has 10 elements that are organized into two components. The first component, Time on Task, is low-inference⁶ whereas the other component, Quality of Teacher Practices, is organized into three areas which are high-inference.

The Time on Task component has one element, Time on Learning, which records if the teacher is providing a learning activity and if students are engaged. The Quality of Teacher Practices component has nine elements which are divided into three areas: Classroom Culture, Instruction, and Socioemotional Skills. Each area has its own elements. Each element has its own set of behaviors that we observe and code to score classrooms and teachers. We can consider these three areas as three broad umbrellas. Underneath each umbrella we have elements, which in turn have observable behaviors. So, before we talk in depth about each of the elements and their respective behaviors, we first need to understand what reliability is and how we will use the tool.

# TEACH PROCEDURES FOR CODING

# RELIABILITY

So, let us explain why it is important to be reliable with the tool. Well, have you ever wanted to lose or gain weight? If you have, you need a scale since you can’t know if you’re successfully changing your weight if you don’t have a measurement. First you need a scale in kilos or pounds, you can’t measure your height since that won’t help you to measure your weight. What happens if I get on the scale and it says 60, and then I get on again and it says 100, how will I know which is my real weight? That scale is not reliable. I need a scale that every time I use it gives me a reliable weight. We want to be trustworthy and reliable scales. Similarly, with the tool, we need to all use the tool in the same way so that we get the same measurements when we are observing the same teacher in the same moment. And this helps us to know we are interpreting and using the tool the same way.

6Low-inference means this element has fewer options for scoring. TOL is scored simply as Yes/No for if the teacher is providing a learning activity and the number of students on task. The rest of the elements are high-inference, which means they are more nuanced as they are scored on a 1-5 scale.

8 WORLD BANK GROUP

# TEACH PROCEDURES FOR CODING

Or, instead of thinking about it as a scale, we can think of the observation tool as a lens to observe the classroom. The tool refers to specific language and terminology of things that we see. Instead of just saying the teacher is “good” we can say specifically what scores were for any particular element, which gives us a specific measurement. To better understand this idea of the lens we will watch a short video.

[Project a 1:00 minute video if possible. Pause the video at 0:24 and ask them how many passes the white team made. Ask if any of them noticed anything else. Do not give an answer, but finish watching the video. If the video is not accessible, continue with the explanation below]

When we are focusing, we only see what we are looking for or what is familiar to us. Has anyone ever had the experience of not noticing something that seems obvious to someone else? Perhaps you have had the experience of not noticing someone standing by you and then you jumped when you noticed they were there. If you are focused on another task, it can be hard to notice anything outside of that task.

Similarly, if you are observing a classroom, what should you look for? Do you pay attention to the teacher, the students, the board, the noise outside the classroom? There can be a lot going on so it’s important that we all understand what exactly we’re looking for so we can be sure to notice what we need to correctly score classrooms. So, if you and I both sit in the same classroom, we should agree on scores and how we value what we are observing. If we don’t both use the same lens, or if we are not both reliable and using the same tool, we will only observe what is familiar to us or what we value. In this training we will learn how to calibrate our own lens and become reliable using the lens of the Teach observation tool.

The tricky thing is everyone has their own experience with education, we all went to school so even if we have not studied education, we at least have the perspective of our time as a student and who we thought was a good teacher. Overcoming these pre-conceived notions of who is an effective teacher is a challenge, but for the Teach tool to work properly, everyone must put aside their pre-conceived notions and use the tool to measure in the way in which it was designed. Doing so will help you pass the Reliability Exam at the end of this training and become effective field coders.

Do any of you have any questions at this point?

# Common challenges in classroom observations

There are enemies of reliability, as you can see on Page 9 of the manual, such as previous experiences and personal beliefs that lead people to think they know what teachers should do. That is a tendency we all have, and we need to be aware of the challenges and identify them so that we do not fall subject to justifying our observations with previous or additional information we may have. Here are some common challenges. May we have six volunteers?

Each one of you can read out one challenge:

[Select volunteers and allow them to read out the following:

- Personal experiences: For example, maybe someone is a local and knows the principal, or the school teacher that is being observed. Or, as mentioned above, maybe something a teacher does reminds them of a positive or negative experience.

TEACH TRAINING MANUAL 9

# TEACH TRAINING DAY 1 SCRIPT

experience they had when they were in school. This may cause observers to unconsciously shift their scores if they do not adhere strictly to the manual.

Using additional information: Perhaps the observer knows the teacher’s relative passed away recently and is aware they are sad and not at their best. This may cause the observer to be more lenient because they know they are dealing with other personal issues and not at their best.

Comparisons: Observers may also unconsciously make comparisons between teachers. For example, maybe you give one teacher a 3 for Supportive Learning Environment and the next teacher’s score also comes out to a 3, but you think the second teacher better than the first teacher and are tempted to bump the score of the second teacher up to a 4. However, that is making comparisons and we shouldn’t be doing that. An experience with one teacher should not have an influence on other teachers’ scores. Score each teacher on their own independently from other observations. Constantly referring to the manual will help you always code reliably.

Separation of elements: Regarding comparison between elements, we want to consider each element on its own, independently. We cannot assume that because a teacher scored high on one behavior or element, they will score high on any other behavior or element.

Weight of specific events or first impressions: Another tendency is to keep the first impression or let information from the first moments in the class have too much influence. This happens to all of us. Maybe the teacher starts with a great introduction that I think that is so good, but the rest of the time is not really what I need to see according to the manual. You have to consider the whole observation, the whole cycle, as objectively as we can.

Central tendency: This happens when we tend to let our scores drift towards Medium when perhaps it should not be. Sometimes there is reluctance to score too many Highs or Lows. However, to be reliable with the tool every score given should be the one that best fits the behavior.

Thank you all. Being aware of these challenges as you learn how to go through this process of observing classrooms and assigning scores will help all of you become reliable with the tool so that you may successfully pass the certification test.

# Note-taking

The first thing we do during the observation is take notes. Does everyone have a note-taking sheet? There is also a copy on Page 15. As we just discussed, being reliable means that two people who are both trained in the Teach tool should get similar scores from watching the same classroom segment. Note-taking is very important for maintaining reliability as it is impossible to remember everything that happens in a 15-minute observation. In addition, we need to have evidence for the scores we will later assign. As the notes help remind us what happened when we are ready to score, it is important to be as detailed and descriptive as possible. Please follow along on Page 7 of the manual.

For example, consider the following examples:

# NOTE-TAKING

- The teacher is respectful with students > ENSURES RELIABILITY
- The teacher says “thank you” and “please” and calls 6 students by their name.

Observers watching the same classroom get similar scores. Helps to remember behaviors observed. Provides evidence for the scores.

# ~DETAILED AND DESCRIPTIVE

Which is more precise?

- The teacher respectful with students
- The teacher says thank you and please and calls students by their names

[Allow participants to answer] Yes, the second example is more precise. We want the second kind of notes. The first example contains an opinion and no evidence. We don’t want to infer or judge, we just want to write down what we observe. The more specific and literal we can be with what the teacher says and what happens in the classroom, the better our scores will be.

10 WORLD BANK GROUP
---
# TEACH PROCEDURES FOR CODING

Everyone has their own system of taking notes, and you should find what works well for you and helps you remember the evidence you saw during the observation. Has anyone ever taken notes in a class (or maybe in this training!)? Would anyone be able to share some technique they used to help them remember what they learned later?

[Allow participants to share some of their experiences and techniques for note-taking]

Great, there are many ways to take notes, though as we saw above, some are better for our purpose than others. On this table are some methods you may use as you develop your own style of note-taking. Good notes are specific and provide evidence for where behaviors fall on the quality range. Let’s consider these techniques:

- Scripting — writing down the exact quote of a teacher or a student can help you remember what happened later.
- Tallies — counting things, such as the number of times a teacher uses student names, asks thinking questions, or uses positive language is especially helpful for behaviors where frequency is a factor.
- Short-hand — use abbreviations, symbols, and letters to help you write faster and take more notes on what you are seeing.
- Anecdotes — write summaries of things you see or hear focusing on the pertinent parts you will need later when coding.

Remember to use some of these techniques: exact quotes, tally marks, short-hand, and anecdotes when developing your style of note-taking — it will help in assigning scores to the behaviors and elements. While these techniques are commonly used by certified Teach observers, find what works for you. Some people prefer to write down everything that happens verbatim, so find what works for you!

Let’s take a few minutes to practice. We’re going to watch a brief, 5-minute video clip of a classroom, please try to take notes using some of the practices we just mentioned.

# NOTE-TAKING PRACTICE EXERCISE

Watch video

[Play video and allow participants to take notes]

Great job everyone!

Let’s look at this slide, here is an example of notes someone took while watching this clip. What do you all notice? What is the same/different from your notes? Would anyone like to volunteer to share their notes with the class?

# NOTE-TAKING PRACTICE EXERCISE

| TECHNIQUE | NOTES                                                |

# TEACH TRAINING DAY 1 SCRIPT

# ASSIGNING SCORES

We will go over details of scoring later in the training, but just to give you a general idea, the elements in the two components are scored slightly differently. The first element, Time on Learning, is low-inference and it simply records if the teacher is providing a learning activity for most students and if so, whether students are on or off task. The behaviors of the other 9 elements are each scored along a range of Low, Medium, or High. These are then translated into an element score, which is on a scale of 1-5.

This is the scoresheet.

[Indicate to the score sheet on the screen]

As we already saw, there is space on the back of the sheet for note-taking. Who can remind us of some of the different note-taking techniques we just discussed?

[Allow participants to answer, try to get four different people to answer for the four techniques mentioned above]

On the front, next to each behavior there are boxes for Low, Medium, High and another space just to the right of those for the final scores. Every behavior needs a quality range assigned and every element needs a final score. Failing to fill in all of the quality ranges and final scores will cause a lot of trouble later on in the analysis of the results. Usually, we start at the top of the sheet with the first behavior and review our notes to remind ourselves of the evidence we saw in the classroom.

We’ll practice assigning scores later in the training. We’ll learn how to assign behavior quality ranges before going over the area of Instruction and we’ll learn how to assign element scores before going over the area of Socioemotional Skills.

# OBSERVER CERTIFICATION AND RELIABILITY EXAM

I’ve mentioned the Reliability Exam and certification process a few times now, so let me explain it in more detail. As I said at the beginning, observers must pass the Teach Reliability Exam before being allowed to conduct Teach classroom observations in the field. The Reliability Exam consists of watching and assigning codes for three, 15-minute videos.

For the Time on Learning element, you are considered reliable if you are in exact agreement with the master score for 2 out of the 3 snapshots.

For the 9 elements in the Quality of Teacher Practices Component, we consider a reliable score to be within one point of the established “master codes” for each element. “Master codes” are scores that have been agreed on by the Teach team and we are treating them as the “right” answers to our practice videos and Reliability Exam videos. So, for example, if the master score is a 3 and you score a 2, 3, or 4, you will be considered reliable for that element.

# OBSERVER MANUAL

To pass the Reliability Exam, you must be reliable on 8 out of the 10 elements for each of the three videos. For example, if you score 100% on the first video, 100% on the second video, and 70% on the third video, you will not pass the exam. If you don’t pass on your first attempt, we will give you feedback and allow you another chance to pass the exam. The second try to pass the Reliability Exam will consist of a different set of three videos. If you do not pass on your second attempt, you will not be certified as a Teach observer, and will not be allowed to carry out Teach classroom observations. Again, we use the Reliability Exam to ensure that only observers who have received proper training and adequately understand the tool become field coders, so we can have confidence that the scores you assign are reliable. The best way to pass the exam? Always remember to refer to and read the manual! Does anyone have any questions?

[Consider asking for a few volunteers at this point to briefly summarize what they’ve learned or share one key takeaway message]

# OBSERVER MANUAL

We’ve now gone over the basics of reliability, common challenges when conducting classroom observations, the procedures for coding, and the reliability exam. Now we will go into more detail for each of the components and elements in the tool.

# TEACH TRAINING DAY 1 SCRIPT

We will follow the order of the manual so please follow along so you can participate in reading and discussions. Let’s look at the manual together, and I will ask people to take turns to read the manual aloud so it is more interactive.

Open the manual on Page 17. You will see that some of the behaviors have little question marks next to their numbers, as 0.1 and 0.2 do. This means there is a Frequently Asked Question for that behavior. As you are reading the manual descriptions and assigning scores, do remember to check the FAQ pages for additional guidance. These may help provide additional insight to assigning quality ranges and final scores. We will go through the FAQs as we go through the different elements.

May we have a volunteer to read the definition for TOL?⁸

[A participant reads]

Thank you. This element has only two behaviors. TOL is scored as three snapshots spaced throughout the classroom observation. Each snapshot is a 1—10 seconds scan of the classroom and only information gathered during the snapshot is used to code the two behaviors in this element.

| 0   | TIME ON LEARNING                                                        |

| 0.1 | The teacher is teaching or provides learning activity for most students |
| 0.2 | Students are on-task                                                    |

May we have a volunteer to read this first behavior? Please read the definition of the behavior, as well as the behavior ranges, including the examples in bullets below.

[A participant reads]

As we can see by the 0.1 in the manual, there is a question mark, which means there is a Frequently Asked Question, or FAQ, associated with that behavior. We will read the FAQs associated with this behavior now, as it is important to familiarize yourselves with them. You should also always remember to refer to these FAQs when coding. May we have a volunteer to read the FAQs for 0.1? They may be found on Page 33.

[A participant reads: 0.1a and 0.1b]

Would someone like to give an example of a learning activity?

[A participant gives an example]

Thank you, so this first behavior, you simply circle Yes or No for each snapshot if the teacher is providing a learning activity to most students or not. If the teacher is not providing a learning activity then behavior 0.2 will be scored as N/A. If the teacher is providing a learning activity then you’ll score 0.2 as High, Medium, or Low. Let’s take a look.

Always try to select a new volunteer to read. Try to choose a new volunteer each time and try to involve a variety of participants, including women, men, people of all ages, etc. While participants should not be forced to read if it makes them uncomfortable, all should be encouraged to do so by reminding them that it is part of the learning process. Use your tracker to know who has not yet participated.

# OBSERVER MANUAL

0.2 May I have another volunteer to read?

[A participant reads]

As I mentioned before, to see if students are on or off task scan the room from left to right and count the number of students that seem to be on or off task at that moment. Refrain from re-counting the same part of the room. Remember to pay special note to what is considered off task behavior. While a student staring out the window may be listening, they would be considered off task as they are more likely distracted. Students who may turn around to look at you would also be considered off task, as such, make sure you don’t move around to get a better view of the room as this could create a distraction for the students. Finally, students who are disrupting the class will also be considered off task.

There is another FAQ for 0.2. May we have a volunteer to read?

[A participant reads]

Why do you think the snapshot is a range, 1-10 second? When might it be 1 second? When might it be 10 seconds? [Participants should understand that the snapshot should take as little amount of time as possible and might take up to 10 seconds depending on how long it takes to count the off task students]

As we mentioned earlier, this element is different from all the rest. For this element you take three “snapshots” and code each of those separately. A snapshot is just a few seconds in which you record what is happening in the classroom at that moment. While you are observing, you will need a stopwatch, phone, or some timepiece to measure when the segment begins, ends, and when to take the snapshots. Just a note, if you do use your phone, make sure it is on silent and will not ring or vibrate during the session to avoid disrupting the class.

Looking at the graphic on the screen or on the scoresheet, you will see the first snapshot should be taken between min 4—5 of the segment, the second snapshot between min 9—10, and the final snapshot between min 14-15. At each snapshot, we will score whether the teacher is providing a learning activity or not, which is behavior 0.1. If the teacher is providing a learning activity, then we scan the room from left to right and count the number of students that appear to be off task, this is behavior 0.2.

Unlike the rest of the elements, you do not need to assign final scores. You should mark the Yes/No and how many students are off task on the score sheet during the observation. After observing the segment, you will not need to go back to this element.

# TEACH TRAINING DAY 1 SCRIPT

So, lets practice quickly with a few short videos to see what this actually looks like. We will watch three very short, 20-second clips and we will discuss after each one. I will start the video, we will watch 10 seconds to get the idea of what is happening, and then we will code the snapshot. Therefore, we will code the snapshot on second 10, remember to keep an eye on the clock. Would someone remind us how long the snapshot should last?

[Allow a participant to answer: 1-10 seconds]

Ok, let’s try it once.

[Play video]

So, what did you all record for 0.1? Was the teacher providing a learning activity?

[Allow participants to share]

For those of you who said there was no learning activity, we know your answer to 0.2, would someone please remind us?

[A participant shares: N/A]

For those of you who said Yes for 0.1, if you scored a Low, please raise one finger, if you scored a Medium, please raise 2 fingers, and if you scored a High, please raise 3 fingers. Would someone like to share who they saw that was off task?

[Allow participants to share, use the opportunity to ensure participants are correctly marking learning activities and off task behavior]

Here you can see the master codes for this clip. Notice that as there is no learning activity provided behavior 0.2 is scored N/A.

[Watch 1-2 more videos to give students the opportunity to practice]

We are going to play a little game throughout the training. As we finish each element, I’ll give you a scenario you will have to guess for which behavior it provides evidence. We’ll build as we go, so it will get a little harder as we add behaviors. Please pull out your game scorecard for this purpose and write your name at the top.

[Give participants a moment to find the game score card and write their name at the top]

Make efforts to create a “culture of error” where making mistakes is celebrated as part of the learning process. Consider responding to students who get the wrong answer with statements such as, “I am so glad you made this error, this is really going to help us learn together” and “Thank you for bravely sharing your answers, while you may not be right, mistakes are important so we can learn.”

# OBSERVER MANUAL

Let me give you a quick example. You’ll see there are simply numbers 1-10 on your scorecard. This is because, as we have learned, we have 10 elements. Each element has its own behaviors, can anyone remind us how many behaviors TOL has that we just learned? [A participant should answer two] The example will have evidence, if it has evidence for both behavior 0.1 and 0.2 then you would write both 0.1 and 0.2; or if it has only evidence for 0.1 you would just write 0.1. As we add more behaviors you’ll write every behavior for which there is some kind of evidence. I’ll remind you again when we get through the next element. Are there any questions?

Don’t cheat or look at other participant scores! We will have prizes at the end for the winners of the game so do your best!10

Ok, for this quiz remember to think about both 0.1 and 0.2 and write down the behaviors for which there is evidence. Consider the following scene:

[Read from the slide:

Students are supposed to be quietly solving problems the teacher has written on the board. Maria is looking out the window while two of her classmates whisper together]

Ok, take a minute to score what you think, keep your scores to yourself and don’t look at other participants’ scorecards. You’ll turn in your sheet at the end of the training and we’ll have prizes.

Let’s continue with the first area in the second component, Classroom Culture.

Plan to have two (simple) prizes — one for the person who gets the most correct scores and one for the person who improves the most. If there is a tie consider a simple game (scissors, paper, rock) or a quick quiz.

# Measuring Quality of Teacher Practices

# A. Classroom Culture [5 min]

[20 mins]

Remember our analogy of umbrellas? Now we’ll take a look at the 9 other elements under the “umbrella” areas. First, let’s take a look at Classroom Culture with its two elements: TEACH Supportive Learning Environment (SLE) and Positive Behavioral Expectations (PBE).

| TME ON | TASK | QUALITY OF CLASSROOM TEACHER CULTURE | Eacup | PRACTICES | INSTRUCTION | LLXD | HDLD | SOCIOEMOTIONAL SKILLS |
| ------ | ---- | ------------------------------------ | ----- | --------- | ----------- | ---- | ---- | --------------------- |

Classroom Culture focuses on the extent to which teachers create a positive environment for learning. It captures the extent to which they create a supportive learning environment for students and how they manage student behavior to ensure that children have a positive classroom culture in which to learn.

# A CLASSROOM CULTURE

# SUPPORTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT

# 1. Supportive Learning Environment

[20 mins]

The first element in Classroom Culture is Supportive Learning Environment, which we commonly abbreviate to SLE. Who would like to read the definition at the top of the page?

[A participant reads the definition for SLE]

# 1. SUPPORTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT

The teacher creates a classroom environment where students can feel emotionally safe and supported. Moreover, all students feel welcome, as the teacher treats all students respectfully.

# OBSERVER MANUAL

Thank you. I’ll take a turn reading this one. As you can see, the behaviors under SLE are as follows: the teacher treats all students respectfully, the teacher uses positive language with students, the teacher responds to student needs, and the teacher does not exhibit gender bias and challenges gender stereotypes in the classroom.

# 1, SUPPORTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT

- 1.1 The teacher treats all students respectfully
- 1.2 The teacher uses positive language with students
- 1.3 The teacher responds to students' needs
- 1.4 The teacher does not exhibit gender bias and challenges gender stereotypes in the classroom

# 1.1 The teacher treats all students respectfully

Let’s look at the first behavior, 1.1 — the teacher treats all students respectfully. Let’s start reading from the High Level and then move towards Low. May we have a volunteer to read? Please always read the description, the behavior ranges, and the examples.

| LOW                    | MEDIUM              | HIGH                            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Ignoring some students | Does not explicitly | Calling students by their names |
| Scolding               | Scold or ridicule   | Thank you, scolding             |
| Shaming/ridiculing     | Physical punishment | Students                        |

Do you see the question mark by the number in the manual? Who would like to read the FAQ for us?

Thank you. So, the High means that the teacher explicitly exhibits signs of respect and does not exhibit signs of disrespect, such as yelling, scolding, or ridiculing students. What might be some ways a teacher might show students respect?

[As every culture has different ways of showing respect help the group identify ways teachers may demonstrate respect in your culture. Perhaps help them think about how they would treat an important guest at the school, etc. help them think not only about the way people “normally” treat children, but how they show respect in general]

In a medium level, the teacher is somewhat respectful, which means that they do not exhibit disrespectful behaviors, but they also do not exhibit explicitly respectful behaviors, such as saying “thank you”, using names, [or use examples you just identified together].

At the Low level, teachers may yell, shame students, or give physical punishment.

[If necessary, remind participants that just because these may be ways teachers “normally” treat students they are still considered signs of disrespect]

Does everyone understand how these behavior ranges work? You will take notes during an observation and then looking at these definitions afterwards you will assign the behavior range that best fits the segment — High, Medium, or Low.

So, when preparing to assign scores for each behavior, we first read these descriptions and FAQs, and then we think, “Which of these descriptions best match what I observed?” Remember that all of the behaviors should be scored for every segment. Besides a few behaviors that have N/A as an option, every behavior will fit into one of these High, Medium, or Low categories.

# TEACH TRAINING DAY 1 SCRIPT

# 1.2

May we have a volunteer to read the definitions for behavior 1.2?

A 1, SUPPORTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT

[A participant reads]

1.2 The teacher uses positive language with students

Do you see the footnote? Always remember to look at these, let’s read these along with the descriptions and behavior ranges. This footnote mentions that only positive language is counted here, not various actions that a teacher may take to reward a student. We also have a FAQ on this one. Who would like to read? Please just read 1.2a.

[A participant reads: FAQ 1.2a]

So, if students clap after one of their fellow students gives the correct answer, that would not be considered as evidence towards this behavior; however, if the teacher says, “let’s give a round of applause” then that would count as evidence as the teacher uses positive language. Remember, we need to follow these rules and definitions in the manual to ensure we all code reliably using Teach.

There’s another FAQ, who would like to read 1.2b?

[A participant reads]

What might be some examples of positive language the teacher may use?

[Let participants answer]

Are there types of language that carry more weight than others?

[Use this discussion to help participants understand that while there is “generic” positive language, such as “good job” and “well done” a teacher saying something such as, “you really mastered this skill and should feel proud of the work” carries more weight than others and using such language only a few times could lead to a high score]

As we are taking notes, any time we hear a teacher using generic positive language, we might put a tick mark on our observation sheet near this behavior. Depending on how many times a teacher uses positive language and the quality of that language, behavior 1.2 will be scored High, Medium, or Low. As mentioned in the FAQ, if the teacher does not use positive language, it will be Low, if the teacher uses generic positive language 1-4 times it is generally a Medium, and if the teacher uses generic positive language 5 or more times it’s generally High. Remember that this behavior is not measuring how “nice” the teacher is or the tone of the class, but how the teacher uses positive language with students to build a Supportive Learning Environment.

Any questions about 1.2? Let’s move on to the next behavior.

# 1.3

The next behavioral marker is 1.3, who would like to read? And please remember the footnote.

[A participant reads]

We have FAQs here as well, FAQ 1.3a and 1.3b are similar, who will volunteer to read both?

[A participant reads: FAQ 1.3a and 1.3b]

Looking at the behavior in the manual and thinking about what you might see in the classroom, what do you think are some more examples of student needs?

[Use a moment to make sure that the participants understand the footnote and are focusing on observable emotional, material, or physical needs]

20 WORLD BANK GROUP
---
# OBSERVER MANUAL

We are aware that not all segments will have observable student needs, if that happens, we have to mark a N/A option. We can mark it as N/A if there are no observable student needs. Just a few reminders about marking a behavior as N/A:

- If we mark a behavior as N/A then it will not affect the score.
- We should always score every behavior and every element and only select N/A for the behaviors that have it as an option on the scoring sheet. Can anyone look on the scoring sheet and tell me which are the only behaviors we can score as N/A?

[Ask for a volunteer]. Thank you. Let’s read the remaining FAQ, 1.3c. A volunteer please?

[A participant reads]

Remember that in the Low the teacher may be aware of student needs but does not address the problem.

# A 1, SUPPORTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT

# 1.3 The teacher responds to student needs

| 88           | LOI                     | mEDIUM                    | HIGH                                          |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Is not aware | Superficially addresses | Responds to student needs | in a way that specifically solves the problem |

# 1.4 The teacher does not exhibit gender bias and challenges gender stereotypes in the classroom

| 88                                                               | LOI                                                              | mEDIUM                                                | HIGH                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Exhibits explicit gender bias against                            | Does not exhibit gender bias in the classroom                    | Treats all genders with                               | challenges gender stereotypes in the classroom |
| Provides unequal opportunities for one gender                    | Provides them with equal opportunities                           | Has low expectations for performance from that gender | Expects high performance from that gender      |
| Uses examples and explanations that reinforce gender stereotypes | Uses examples and explanations that challenge gender stereotypes |                                                       |                                                |

As [insert name] just mentioned, this is another behavior that can be scored N/A if the class is all boys or all girls. Remember that N/A is only to be used for classrooms that only have one gender. Please remember that you will need to consider the ratio of boys to girls when considering if all genders have equal opportunity to participate. Also, for this behavior, if there is no explicit evidence of gender bias and no evidence of challenging gender stereotypes then this behavior will be scored as a medium.

What are some of the ways we might see teachers exhibiting gender bias?

[Discuss some of the ways they might see gender bias, if participants are having a difficult time generating examples, ask guiding questions or provide suggestions]

What are some of the ways teachers might challenge gender stereotypes?

[Lead a similar discussion. Note: teachers can challenge gender stereotypes in non-verbal ways as well. For example, if it is counter-cultural for girls and boys to be sitting next to one another or for boys to clean the board, and the teacher creates these situations this may also be considered evidence]

So, that is the overview of element 1 — SLE. We will now watch a short video and start getting some practice with identifying behaviors. Remembering what we learned earlier about note-taking, please take notes in your notebook on what you observe during this clip, and then we will share our observations afterwards. Don’t worry about assigning scores, just try to write down, in as much detail and as descriptively as possible, what you see.

[Play video]

TEACH TRAINING MANUAL 21

# TEACH TRAINING DAY 1 SCRIPT

What did you observe during this segment? Who would like to share some of their notes?

[Allow participants to share their notes and give positive feedback for participants who took specific notes with frequency counts and specific evidence. When discussing use language from the manual as much as possible.]

[Lead a brief discussion on the evidence for the various behaviors seen in the video. For all videos, allow discussion to flow — you may consider using the Discussion Sheet or the following questions to get things started:]

- What makes sense to you/what did you get?
- What is still confusing?
- Is there anything important you missed/didn’t take notes on in the video?

Does anyone have questions on SLE? Let’s take 5 minutes to discuss in small groups [or pairs] one thing you learned and one thing you are still unsure about.

[Make sure everyone either has a partner or a small group. Give participants about 5 minutes to discuss SLE, while you circulate the room to monitor the discussions]

Would any group like to share a lingering question they have?

[Take another 5 minutes to answer lingering questions if necessary, if not, move on]

Ok, here’s our scenario for our game, remember to write down the behaviors that are present. As TOL is a separate component we will only score the behaviors in this component, so look for evidence for behaviors 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4. Write down whichever behaviors have evidence present on your scorecard, remember that this is #2. Keep your codes to yourself!

# GAME QUESTION 2

[Read from the slide:]

A student stands up to answer a question given by the teacher, who responds by saying, “Let’s now complete the exercises written on the board. Nura, you don’t have a pencil? Does anyone have one they can lend her?” No one answers. She continues, “Of course, I wouldn’t expect one of the boys to be so prepared, but none of you girls has an extra pencil either?” The students work on completing the exercises written on the board in their notebook and the teacher continues writing the next problem on the board.

# OBSERVER MANUAL

# 2. Positive Behavioral Expectations

[20 mins]

The next element is Positive Behavior Expectations or PBE. We’ll go through the same process we just did for SLE. So, who can read the element description, which is at the top of Page 21?

A CLASSROOM CULTURE

# 2. POSITIVE BEHAVIORAL EXPECTATIONS

The teacher promotes positive behavior by acknowledging students behavior that meets or exceeds expectations. Moreover, the teacher sets clear behavioral expectations for different parts of the lesson.

This element has three behaviors. I’ll take a turn and read the behaviors. The three behaviors are: the teacher sets clear behavioral expectations, the teacher acknowledges positive student behavior, and the teacher redirects misbehavior and focuses on the expected behavior rather than the undesired behavior.

# 2.1 The teacher sets clear behavioral expectations for classroom activities

Let’s start with behavior 2.1. May we have a volunteer to read?

A

[A participant reads]

So, the first thing we want to see is the teacher setting clear behavioral expectations. Sometimes teachers set rules at the beginning of the year and sometimes they will set expectations for each activity. For example, some activities should be completed silently while others may have specific expectations for how students should work together, raise their hands when they are done, etc. There also may be classrooms where we don’t see the teacher setting behavioral expectations, but we can tell the students know how they are expected to behave.

Please look again at the footnote and remember the way we define misbehavior for the purpose of the Teach tool. If a student is not being disruptive, does not distract other students, and does not upset the teacher, we consider the students well-behaved, and so might consider scoring this behavior a High even if we do not observe the teacher setting clear behavioral expectations.

It is also important to note that we are not measuring if the students follow clear behavioral expectations in behavior 2.1. We will see afterwards in 2.3 how teachers deal with behaviors. As such, this behavior may still be high if the students are misbehaving, provided the teacher is setting clear behavioral expectations throughout the class.

Would someone volunteer to read the FAQ for us?

[A participant reads]

TEACH TRAINING MANUAL 23

# TEACH TRAINING DAY 1 SCRIPT

# 2. POSITIVE BEHAVIORAL EXPECTATIONS

# 2.2

The second behavior in this element shows us if the teacher is reinforcing positive behaviors by acknowledging students who are behaving well.

Who would like to read behavior 2.2?

| LOW                  | MEDIUM                                      | HIGH                                           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Does not acknowledge | Superficially acknowledges student behavior | Specifically acknowledges student expectations |

[A participant reads]

Would someone provide an example of what they think would be the difference between “superficially acknowledging” in the Medium and “specifically” in the High?

[Participants can come up with their own examples, focus on the fact that it is specific “thank you for raising your hand as I asked” vs general “you’re behaving well”]

So, the teacher has set clear behavior expectations (2.1) but the students do not follow the expected behavior and misbehavior happens, what does the teacher do?

# 2.3

Who can read 2.3?

[A participant reads]

2.3 The teacher redirects misbehavior and focuses on the expected behavior; rather than undesired behavior

Remember the footnote and to follow the definition of misbehavior.

| LOW                           | MEDIUM                              | HIGH                                                               |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Focuses on misbehavior rather | Redirects misbehavior superficially | Effectively redirects misbehavior by focusing on positive behavior |

No matter how well or poorly you may think the students are having it’s important we follow the manual.

There is a FAQ for 2.3 as well. Who would like to read?

[A participant reads]

So, provided there is misbehavior, how does the teacher respond? We can ask ourselves two questions:

- Does the teacher focus on the misbehavior or the expected behavior?
- Is the redirection ineffective or effective?

If the teacher focuses on misbehavior and is ineffective it is a Low, if it’s a mixture, it is a Medium, and if the teacher focuses on the expected behavior and it is effective the score is a High.

Would someone be able to explain the difference between focusing on the misbehavior and focusing on the expected behavior?

[Allow a participant to respond]

Great, thank you. Does anyone have questions about PBE? We’re now going to watch a similarly short video and take some notes. Don’t worry about also taking notes for SLE, just try to focus only on PBE for now.

What did you observe?

[Allow participants to share & discuss what they observed and what notes they took. Use feedback to affirm good note-taking and observations and use the opportunity to clarify any misconceptions. Remember to be specific in your feedback]

# OBSERVER MANUAL

[Lead a brief discussion on the evidence for the various behaviors seen in the video.]

Ok, are you all ready for the game slide? Remember to refer to the manual if you are unsure and score all the behaviors we have learned so far in this component. Can anyone remind us of all seven behaviors?

Ok great, here’s the scenario:

# VIDEO 2. POSITIVE BEHAVIORAL EXPECTATIONS

The teacher both sets clear behavioral expectations and the students are very well behaved: Before they read their story; she tells them "Before we read that; first, what do we have to remember? What do we need to do? First: No standing; what else? No noisy; let's not make any noise: Don't run around, yes: Don't be rowdy; what else? You listen so you can answer the questions" (2.1).

The teacher does not acknowledge student behavior that meets or exceeds expectations (2.2).

The teacher is not observed redirecting students' behavior; but the students are well-behaved throughout the lesson (2.3).

[Allow participants to list the seven behaviors learned so far. If someone mentioned TOL remind them that we are only identifying evidence for the behaviors in this component for the game]

# GAME QUESTION 3

Scenario

"Great job everyone!" the teacher says as the students complete a quiz. "Now we are going to work on a group project. Remember to listen to your classmates when they are speaking; you should speak one at a time and make sure everyone gets the chance to offer their opinion:" During the group project the teacher says, "I like how group two is behaving." She walks around to group one to check on how their work is coming.

Remember, only write down the behaviors for which you see explicit evidence.

# Classroom Culture Video

[10 mins]

Classroom Culture is a small area with only two elements. Now we will put it all together, SLE and PBE. We will watch a 5-minute video and look for evidence of all the behaviors in this area. Would someone please remind us what behaviors for which we will be looking?

[Allow participants to mention the seven behaviors, note that it is only the seven behaviors in this component]

Please try to take detailed notes on all the behaviors included in these two elements. Once we watch the video, you will have 5 minutes to discuss in your small groups. Let’s watch the video.

[Play video]

What did you observe? Please engage in brief discussion with your small groups to share what you observed. You will have 5 minutes to discuss and I will raise my hand when the 5 minutes is over and we will reconvene to discuss. I would ask you to not worry about assigning scores just yet, but first simply analyze what evidence is present for the behaviors in the tool.

[Allow participants to share & discuss]

Who would like to try and map your observations to elements or behaviors we have discussed?

[Allow participants and groups to share before you reveal the slide with the mapped behaviors]

TEACH TRAINING MANUAL 25

# TEACH TRAINING DAY 1 SCRIPT

Good job! Let’s take a look here and see what we all identified and what we may have missed.

# Video of Classroom Culture:

The teachers are respectful with all students by using names when addressing students and never scolding or yelling at the students (1.1): The teacher uses positive language by saying "very good" and instructing the class to clap for their fellow student by saying, "let's give him three claps" (1.2). There are no observed student needs when the teacher does mention what students can do if they do not have a whiteboard; this does not address an actual need as there is no student need apparent (1.3). The teacher provides equal opportunities for both genders and does not present any implicit bias. However, she does not challenge gender stereotypes (1.4): The teacher provides some behavioral expectations by saying "Let's work individually" and "When you are finished, when you hear the bell, we raise the whiteboards together." Although the students may appear well-behaved, the teacher does not acknowledge students' behavior that meets or exceeds expectations (2.2). Also, generally the students are well-behaved and when misbehavior arises, the teacher focuses on the expected behavior. For example, she shows a student his seat and says "sit down here" (2.3).

Does anyone find themselves struggling with some of the common challenges in classroom observations? Does anyone find themselves thinking “this is a good/bad teacher?” What are some things you attribute to “good” teaching? “Bad” teaching?

[Allow participants to share, having them express their pre-conceived notions makes it easier for them to be aware of them and avoid introducing bias into their coding]

While it is completely normal to have those thoughts, we must prevent those thoughts from affecting the scores. Always go back to the manual. Remember to try to take notes that are evidence for the specific behaviors we are learning.

Congratulations, you’ve learned one area of the Teach tool! We will now take a short 15-minute break. When we return, we will talk about assigning behavior quality ranges and will move onto the second area, Instruction.

# Break [15 mins]

Now that we’ve learned to observe and take notes on behaviors, we will review the process of assigning behavior quality ranges.

# TEACH: QUALITY RANGES

After the video is over and as you review your notes, you always go to the manual. Let’s open the manual to Page 23 and see the first element page in the area of Instruction. Each behavior has a description for High, Medium, and Low, which we have already seen in our review of Classroom Culture. When you are ready to assign behavior quality ranges make sure you read your notes and compare them with the descriptions provided in the manual similar to what we did with mapping evidence to various behaviors.

When assigning scores, remember that it is very important for observers to adhere to the manual as closely as possible whether or not you agree with it. After you read the descriptions for High, Medium, and Low for each behavior you will then assign one range (High, Medium, or Low) for every behavior. The only exceptions here are 4 behaviors, three of which we have already seen: 0.2, 1.3, 1.4, and 4.2 that are eligible to be scored as non-applicable, or N/A — it is not used with the other behaviors. Behaviors scored as N/A should not influence the element score.

# Assigning Behavior Quality Ranges

[5 mins]

Note here as well that if you do need to change a score on the sheet, make sure it’s clearly changed by erasing your original mark completely, or clearly crossing your first response out.

26 WORLD BANK GROUP
---
# OBSERVER MANUAL

Here you can see an example of a correctly filled-in score sheet or look at Page 9 in your manual. Note that each behavior has a clearly assigned quality range and every element has a final score. Remember that we always want to have both the score sheet and the manual when observing. Even if you feel you know the tool very well, it is always important to use the manual when you observe and code. Every classroom is different. We must keep coming back to the manual, referring to the descriptions and examples, to ensure reliability. For the purpose of this training, whenever we talk about the tool we are referring to both the manual and the observation sheet.

Let’s do a quick check, please give me a thumbs-up if you understand how to assign behavior quality range scores, thumbs-down if you feel you’re missing something, and thumb-sideways if you think you get it, but you’re not confident. [Check everyone’s answer, ask follow-up questions for those with thumbs-down, such as, “which part seems to be giving you trouble?”]

We will discuss assigning the element score before we talk about the final area, but for now, let’s continue with our review of the second area — Instruction.

# B. Instruction

[5 mins]

As you can see, Instruction is our second area in the component of Quality of Teacher Practices.

| TEACH | QUALITY OF TEACHER PRACTICES | CLASSROOM CULTURE | INSTRUCTION | SOCIOEMOTIONAL SKILLS |
| ----- | ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------- | --------------------- |

This area has 4 elements: Lesson Facilitation, Checks For Understanding, Feedback, and Critical Thinking. The behaviors in this area help us observe what the teacher does to promote deep and meaningful learning and understanding.

Let’s go back to the manual and open Page 23.

# LESSON FACILITATION

# CHECKS FOR UNDERSTANDING

# FEEDBACK

# CRITICAL THINKING

TEACH TRAINING MANUAL 27

# TEACH TRAINING DAY 1 SCRIPT

# 3. Lesson Facilitation

[25 mins]

The first element is Lesson Facilitation (LF), which has four behaviors.

# B. INSTRUCTION

# 3. LESSON FACILITATION

The teacher facilitates the lesson to promote comprehension by explicitly articulating the objectives, providing clear explanations of concepts, and connecting the lesson with other content knowledge or students' experiences.

These four behaviors are all aligned at observing what the teacher does to promote comprehension. The teacher should explicitly articulate the specific objective of activities in class. Teacher’s explanations are clear, and the teacher makes connections in the lesson that relate to other content knowledge or student’s daily lives. Finally, the teacher models by enacting or thinking out loud.

# 3.1

Who would like to read 3.1?

[A participant reads]

Who would like to share their understanding of what a “lesson objective” is with the rest of the group?

[Allow a participant to share. Make sure they understand that for Teach the lesson objective should say “why” the class is doing the activity rather than “what” activity they are doing]

Thank you all for sharing. So, with that in mind, what is the difference between the Medium and the High?

[Make sure they note that in the High the lesson objective is specific, is explicitly stated, and aligns with the lesson activities]

So, the lesson objective tells the students, as well as we observers, for what purpose the class is completing an activity.

I will pose this FAQ to you as a question. Try not to look at the answer first! Students are just reading and discussing a story for class. The teacher says, “Today we’re going to talk about [title of story].” Does this count as stating the lesson objective? If you think it counts as a lesson objective, please raise your hand.

[Participants raise their hands, make notes on tracker as time permits]

If you think it does not count, please raise your hand.

[Participants raise their hands, make notes on tracker as time permits]

May we have a volunteer to read the answer? And remember, we are all learning so whether or not we get it right, it’s important that we try. It’s by putting forth our effort that we all have the opportunity to learn and improve ourselves, so you’re all doing a great job, just from trying! Go ahead.

# OBSERVER MANUAL

[A participant reads the FAQ answer]

Thank you, does anyone have any additional questions? Let’s look at the next behavior.

# 3. LESSON FACILITATION

# 3.2 The teacher’s explanation of the content is clear

| MEDIUM                                              | HIGH                                                              |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Parts of the content is                             | The teacher’s explanation of the content is confusing             |
| The content is simply not explained                 | The teacher does not fully explain the meaning of technical terms |
| The teacher explains the meaning of technical terms |                                                                   |

Do note that this behavior is only about clarity of a teacher’s explanations, not on accuracy of content. If the teacher gives a clear definition of a verb, it could be scored a High, even if the definition is incorrect. This is important so you, the observers, are not obliged to worry about if what the teacher is saying is correct or not, simply if the explanations are clear and easy to understand. Here we have to think from the student’s perspective. If I were a student in the class would I understand? That is what we have to consider in terms of clarity.

The next behavior relates to how the teacher helps students learn with meaningful content.

# 3.3 The teacher makes connection the lesson that relate to other content knowledge or student's daily lives

| LOW                                     | MEDIUM                                              | HIGH                                                                         |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The teacher does not connect the lesson | Parts of the content is confusing                   | The teacher connects the explanation of the content to students' daily lives |
| The teacher does not explain            | The teacher explains the meaning of technical terms |                                                                              |

We see that this behavior has FAQs, please turn to Page 34. We will read and discuss these FAQs in small groups.

[Give groups 3 minutes]

What is considered a meaningful connection? Can anyone think of a few more examples?

[Allow a few people to answer]

Remember that connections can be to daily life or prior content knowledge, sometimes people forget that is an option.

# 3.4

Who would like to read 3.4?

[A participant reads]

Modeling is something that is a little complicated and as such let’s turn to the FAQs on Page 35. This behavior has a lot of FAQs, would someone please read FAQ 3.4d?

[A participant reads]

As we can see, one of the first things we can do is ask ourselves, “Is the thing students are being asked to do a process or a thinking skill?” Then you can ask, “Does the teacher show how to perform the task, or give verbal explanations to the thinking skill?” If so, then the teacher could be partially or completely modeling.

Take a few minutes to read and discuss the remainder of the FAQs with your small group again.

TEACH TRAINING MANUAL 29
---
# TEACH TRAINING DAY 1 SCRIPT

[Give groups 5 minutes]

# 3. LESSON FACILITATION

As you can see, in FAQ 3.4b modeling can happen at any point during the segment, but for something to be considered modeling students should have the opportunity to practice a similar activity, or it should be evident that they will practice in the near future.

For another example to help identify modeling: we may think, “What is the task or learning activity that the teacher wants students to do? Is it to write sentences? If so, then, did the teacher model any parts? The whole process? If it’s a math problem, did he model the thinking process?”

Remember that the difference between a Medium and a High here is that the teacher partially or fully models the learning activity. Does anyone have additional questions on modeling? Maybe from your group discussion?

[If a group has questions, ask if any other group would try and help them answer/understand]

Those are all four of the behaviors for LF. We will now watch a short video. We will again practice taking notes and then will share what we observed.

This time we will work together as a group after the video to assign some scores for each of the behaviors.

[Play video]

# 3. LESSON FACILITATION: PRACTICE VIDEO

What did you observe?

[Allow participants to share & discuss]

Let’s try to assign some scores to what we saw. May I have a volunteer to record which behavior scores are assigned?

[Select a participant to be the recorder]

Considering the evidence everyone has shared for 3.1, what score do you think we should assign?

[Work together as a whole group to assign scores, help guide the group to the correct answer, but do not force it allow to choose an incorrect answer if they all/most agree. This will let you know you need to adjust and clarify misunderstandings for that behavior range.

After people share their ideas ask follow-up questions such as: “Do others agree?”, “Why?”, “Who disagrees and why?”]

Great discussion, let’s have a look at the master code to what the behavior ranges are. [Insert Name] would you remind us of the scores that we agreed upon? What do you think we did well? What did we miss?

[Lead a brief discussion on the evidence for the various behaviors seen in the video and the scores assigned. Focus on behaviors they missed. During discussion, try to avoid simply answering participants questions. Instead, encourage other participants to take the role of the teacher and try and help explain things to one another]

Ok, here’s our scenario for the game. At this point, can anyone let us know for how many behaviors we should be looking?

[A participant answers: 11]

# OBSERVER MANUAL

# B GAME QUESTION 4

Scenario

One student is whispering to her neighbor. The teacher says, “Tanya, please look at the board so you can see the example.” He then continues while pointing to a drawing on the board, “So here we have 3 groups of 2 apples. If we count all the apples we get — one, two, three, four, five, six. We can see this is the same as if we multiply 2 x 3.” The students watch the teacher and then he gives them two examples to solve on their own.

Remember to only write down the behaviors for which we see explicit evidence. For example, I’ll give you a hint here: while we can infer the objective of the lesson is to learn multiplication, as the teacher doesn’t give any explicit evidence, we wouldn’t count it here. We will now move to the next element, Checks For Understanding (CFU).

# 4. CHECKS FOR UNDERSTANDING

[25 mins]

Who can read the element definition?

[A participant reads]

# B. INSTRUCTION

# 4. CHECKS FOR UNDERSTANDING

The teacher checks for understanding to ensure most students comprehend the lesson content. Moreover, the teacher adjusts the pace of the lesson to provide students with additional learning opportunities.

We have three behaviors here, would you also read these?

[The same participant continues reading]

# B 4. CHECKS FOR UNDERSTANDING

1. The teacher uses questions, perhaps, or other strategies to determine students' understanding.
2. The teacher monitors most students during independent/group work.
3. The teacher adjusts teaching to the level of students.

# 4.1

Thank you. May we have another volunteer to read the descriptions for 4.1?

[A participant reads]

We also have some FAQs for this behavior. May we have a volunteer read them for us?

# TEACH TRAINING DAY 1 SCRIPT

So, with that additional information, how about another example of a High for 4.1? Would anyone like to suggest something we could do to effectively check the understanding of everyone in this group?

# CHECKS FOR UNDERSTANDING

[Invite a volunteer participant to come up to the front to lead the activity. Have them share their idea of how they could check the understanding of the group. They may do a general “temperature check” on the whole tool, a specific topic, or a specific behavior. Have the volunteer share their idea before they begin so you can ensure it would indeed be a High CFU. If it is not, help them/get the group to help them think about how they could make slight modifications to improve it and bump it up to a High. Some ideas:

- Have the volunteer create an example scenario for a particular behavior and have participants raise their hands to indicate if they think it’s a Low, Medium, or High.
- Have them create a True/False statement about some item in the tool and have participants give a thumbs up/thumbs down if they think the statement is true or false.
- Ask a question with a short answer, such as, “what is one way a teacher could demonstrate respect” and have participants write down their answers on a piece of paper and hold them up for the volunteer to observe.

Everyone did a really nice job participating, thank you! Please give our volunteer teacher a round of applause for his/her great CFU! Notice that while the teacher does need to be able to see/obtain the information on student understanding this behavior does not measure whether or not the teacher does anything with that information. Let’s look at the next behavior.

# 4.2

4.2, who can read the definition?

# CHECKS FOR UNDERSTANDING

[A participant reads]

Does anyone notice/remember what is a little bit different about this behavior?

[Allow participants to answer]

This is one of the three behaviors for which N/A is an option. When might we use N/A?

[Answer is: When there is no observable independent/group work]

So, if there is no observable independent or group work, then this behavior is scored N/A. If there is any independent or group work then the segment must fit into one of the High, Medium, or Low behavior ranges.

Who would like to read the FAQs for this behavior?

[A participant reads]

Now for the final behavior in element 4.

# OBSERVER MANUAL

# 4.3 A volunteer?

[A participant reads] Thank you, and another volunteer to read our FAQ?

[A participant reads] What do you all think are some ways a teacher could adjust?

[A teacher may adjust by re-explaining a concept, giving additional examples, provide additional time for students to consider/complete a task, explain something in a new way, etc.]

What we’re looking for in the difference between Medium and High is a substantial adjustment versus a brief adjustment. Would anyone like to provide an example of each?

[Allow a volunteer to make up an example]

We have now made it through CFU, we will watch an element video now, please remember to take notes. We will again assign behavior ranges together as a group after watching the video.

[Play video]

# 4. CHECKS FOR UNDERSTANDING: VIDEO PRACTICE

What did you observe? What behavior ranges should we assign?

May we have another volunteer to be the recorder?

[Allow participants to share & discuss. Encourage as much participant lead discussion and follow-up as feasible]

Good job, let’s see what the behavior ranges are. [Insert Name] would you tell us the scores that we agreed upon? What do you think we did well? What did we miss?

The teacher is somewhat effective at checking students' understanding as she only checks the understanding of a few students. Although she calls on students that volunteer to participate, it appears the entire class has volunteered and thus she is effectively choosing from all the students. Specifically; she asks two students to go to the board and explain in their own words what they learned during the lesson (4.1: M): The teacher monitors students during the independent activity although some students are sharing the textbook by walking around the classroom and approaching some students to repeat instructions (4.2: H): The teacher does not adjust teaching (4.3: L):

Here is our game scenario. Remember, we are looking for explicit evidence, no matter what the quality range would be, but the evidence must be explicit.

[Read from the slide: The teacher says, “Today, we will learn how to identify action verbs. Quietly copy down the sentences written on the board into your notebooks and circle any action verbs. You shouldn’t be talking with your neighbors. You will have 10 minutes to complete the activity. Ok, does everyone understand?” To which the students all answer, “Yes.” The students begin working. After the 10 minutes she says, “Are you all done?”, a few students say “yes”, but most say “no.” The teacher says, “Ok, take another minute, but try to finish quickly.”]

Would anyone like to ask a question? Maybe something that is unclear or that you would like another example? How is everyone feeling?

# OBSERVER MANUAL

This element is a little different as there are only two markers and as you can see, they are relatively similar. Essentially, both are looking for comments or prompts the teacher uses to help students identify misunderstandings (5.1) and understand successes (5.2). While these comments or prompts should be more than simple evaluative statements — such as correct and incorrect — there are a variety of ways in which teachers can provide feedback.

Would anyone like to share some ideas of ways a teacher might use comments or prompts?

[Lead a brief discussion. Remember, prompts may be seen as questions or statements the teacher uses to help students think through things themselves. Below are some ways a teacher might use feedback:

- Why do you think you might have obtained an incorrect answer?
- Here you used a different formula.
- What might you be able to do differently?
- Which part might be what is giving you trouble?
- Which part did you get correct?
- You did a great job with that equation because you remembered to carry over.
- How do you think you could use what you learned from the previous question that you answered correctly to work on this problem?

At the High level, teachers’ comments or prompts should be specific, full comments. In the Medium level, there may be some comments, but they are too general.

We do have a FAQ here, who would like to read?

[A participant reads]

As with all our elements, the feedback needs to be observable. We cannot assume that a teacher who is marking students’ papers is giving written feedback as they could just as easily simply be marking things correct or incorrect. The feedback should be something you can clearly see or hear. Remember to not get up and try to see students’ workbooks, this may make them uncomfortable and you may miss something else happening in the classroom.

Here is a video, please remember to take notes. While these two behaviors are similar, do remember to note if feedback helps students identify misunderstandings or understands success so you can properly map your notes to the appropriate behavior. This time, after the video you will work together in your small groups to assign behavior range scores and then we will do a whole-group discussion.

The teacher provides specific comments about students' work which allow them to clarify their misconceptions. For example; during independent work, she says, "Let me see. You have to write it. To make sense you have to say; 'ascending order' and 'descending order'. With what number should ascending order start? Biggest or smallest?" The student responds, "The smallest." But you started with the biggest: Ascending order starts with smallest; so it has to be like this:

Ok, here is our game slide.

# GAME QUESTION 6

[Read from the slide:]

A student comes to the board to solve an equation in front of the class but cannot find a piece of chalk. The teacher notices and gives the student a piece. The student proceeds to solve the equation and the teacher tells the rest of the class to solve the equation on their own paper. The teacher watches the student at the board and points out a mistake by saying, "Did you carry your tens?" The student fixes the error and obtains an answer. The teacher then asks the class, "Who got the same answer as Abdul? Raise your hands." She scans the room and proceeds, "Is it the correct answer?" To which the whole class answers, "Yes." The teacher then says, "Good job" and the student sits down.

Is anyone hungry? Let’s take our lunch break, we’ll have one hour.

[Lunch Break]

Welcome back everyone. I hope you are feeling refreshed as now, we will move to the next element, Critical Thinking (CT).

# 6. CRITICAL THINKING

[45 mins]

As you can see on Page 26 of the manual, this is another element that looks a little different. This is because the developers of the Teach tool understand that CT is a little trickier to reliably observe and code, so they provided lots of examples to help make sure we can understand for what it is we are looking.

Would someone go ahead and read the element definition?

Thank you. In short, for the High, the teacher asks three or more open-ended questions and at least one of these questions builds upon student response. At the Medium level the teacher asks at least two open-ended questions but doesn’t meet the requirements for High.

| Low                                                               | Medium                                                                                              | High                                                                                                                 |

Who would like to read the FAQ for 6.1?

[A participant reads]

This means, even if a teacher asks 10 open-ended questions, but none of them builds on a student’s response it would still be scored as Medium.

In terms of what is considered an open-ended question, as indicated in the definition, it is one that requires reasoning, explanation, or generalization or has more than one correct answer. Who can give me an example of an open-ended question as defined by the Teach manual?

[Allow a few participants to answer and discuss as necessary]

Are there any questions? We’ll spend a little more time on 6.2.

# 6.2 The teacher provides thinking tasks that require students to actively analyze content, as opposed to simply receiving information or building fluency

Would someone please read the definition and behavior ranges?

[A participant reads]

Thank you. So, we have three categories of classrooms. Those with no thinking tasks, those with superficial thinking tasks, and those with substantial thinking tasks. As we talk about thinking tasks, just note that these definitions hold for both 6.2 and 6.3.

Please close your manual for a moment so you don’t look at the example bank, as we’re going to use it for an exercise in just a minute. So, what is a thinking task? They are tasks that require students to actively analyze content, as opposed to simply receiving information or building fluency.

What does that mean in practice? Would anyone like to give an example of the difference between a thinking task and a non-thinking task?

¹¹ If necessary, make sure participants are also reading the part of the behavior definition

# TEACH TRAINING DAY 1 SCRIPT

[Have a brief discussion on what it means for students to “actively analyze content, as opposed to simply receiving information or building fluency]

To help flesh all this out, we are going to go through some examples together. I’m going to read out an example and you will decide as a small group if it fits in the Low, Medium, or High category. You will have one minute to decide. At the end of the minute, please have a representative raise their hand with one finger raised for a Low, two fingers indicate a Medium, and 3 fingers indicate a high. Ok, are we ready?

[Have a few pre-selected scenarios from the Thinking Task Tables (5-6), read them out and give groups one minute to discuss. Consider using a timer, or, choose a short amount of time. You don’t want participants stressing about the answer as the goal is learning but you do want them to engage with the material. Check if most people are getting a certain behavior range right or wrong and consider adjusting to add an extra example or two if necessary]

What does everyone think about thinking tasks, would you like another exercise?

[If participants need more work on this behavior and you have time consider adding this additional activity]

Ok, create your own scenario. You can create a Low, Medium, or High thinking task, though I would encourage you to choose Medium or High. Write down your scenario on a piece of paper — make sure it would be observable in a classroom by an observer. Then, please work with a partner to share your scenario and have your partner guess which level. Help each other make your examples better.

[Give participants 5-10 minutes to think of an example and work with their partner. After they’re all done have a few people share what they created. Monitor the group while they work and help them as necessary]

Great work everyone! There is a FAQ for 6.2, may we have a volunteer to read?

[A participant reads]

Any more questions? I think you all are doing very well with identifying thinking tasks at this point. Thinking tasks are also included in 6.3.

# 6.3

May we please have a volunteer to read the next behavior?

[A participant reads]

The student asks open-ended questions or complete thinking tasks. For this behavior, we use the same definition of open-ended questions as in 6.1 and the same definition of thinking task as 6.2. Many times, 6.2 and 6.3 will go hand-in-hand, but sometimes they may not. For example, teachers might provide great thinking tasks, but students may not engage in the activity. You may notice that this behavior is a little different — it is focused on the students instead of the teacher.

Who would like to read the FAQ?

[A participant reads, engage in additional discussion if necessary]

Are there any questions?

[If participants have more questions or want more examples, consider taking the extra time to either go through the remaining examples in the manual or have them do so as small groups or pairs]

Again, it is important to remember that while these three behaviors do relate to one another, you should never assume that just because one is scored High, the other behaviors should also be scored High. Remember to score each behavior independently.

# OBSERVER MANUAL

We will now watch the CT video. Use the examples we discussed to inform your understanding, but remember the list of examples is not comprehensive, they are there to help you eventually identify thinking tasks on your own. After the video, we will again work in small groups to assign the behavior scores.

# What did you observe?

B 6, CRITICAL THINKING: PRACTICE VIDEO

[Allow participants to share & discuss in their small groups. Monitor the group and consider using the following questions, as appropriate for the video, to help groups think through:

- Did the teacher ask open-ended questions?
- Did the teacher build on student responses?
- Was there a thinking task?
- Was it superficial or substantial?
- Did the students carry out the thinking tasks?
- Did the students ask open-ended questions?

# Who would like to share their scores with the group? Why did you choose the score you did?

B VIDEO: 6 CRITICAL THINKING

The teacher asks several thinking questions to make students analyze the reading: He says "Do you respect your family?" and he builds upon their responses by asking follow-up questions: "Because they're old: So that baby in the lobby; you don't respect him because he's young?" asked if you respect your family: "Why do you respect your family?" (6.1: H) The teacher provides thinking tasks to students by answering thinking questions (per FAQ 6.3) that challenge them to analyze content specifically; the teacher uses thinking questions to guide students in analyzing the reading about the importance of family: few students do give thoughtful responses, such as when the student answers, "Because as soon as you were born you've met your grandma" (6.2: H) The students do not ask thinking questions. Only few students answer the questions prompted by the teacher with thoughtful responses, which means that they are performing some thinking tasks; however, many give one-word answers and do not seem to engage in the level of analysis towards which the teacher is striving (6.3: M):

# GAME QUESTION 7

[Read from the slide:]

The teacher has written a paragraph on the board and says, "First, I want you to copy down the paragraph in your notebook. Once you have written it out you should put boxes around the nouns, circles around the verbs, and triangles around the adjectives." He proceeds to ask the students, "What are some ways you can identify a noun?" A student says, "If it’s capitalized, like a name." The teacher responds, "Yes, that’s possible, but what if it’s at the beginning of a sentence?" and a student says, "The beginning of a sentence is always capitalized so maybe it’s not a noun." The students proceed to complete the assignment.

Great job, CT is a difficult element, but you are asking good questions and participating well in discussions, which are all helping you understand and master this aspect of Teach!

# Instruction Video

[30 mins]

Watch the video

OK, now we will watch another video, and will focus on the whole area of Instruction. Does anyone remember all the Instruction elements?

[Allow a participant to answer: Lesson Facilitation, Checks For Understanding, Feedback, Critical Thinking]

We will also practice scoring all the behaviors as Low, Medium, or High. This time, you’ll try assigning scores by yourself. Remember to take detailed notes and always read the descriptions in the manual and any FAQs before assigning your score. Your scores should not be your opinion, they should be supported by the notes of the evidence you saw in the video.

Good. Let’s use the observation sheet to take notes and score the behaviors. You can use the same one we used for the Classroom Culture video if you have space. OK, is everyone ready?

[Play video]

Ok, go ahead and use your manual to assign behavior scores. Don’t worry about assigning the element score just now, we’ll do that later. We’ll have 10 minutes, don’t worry about getting it perfect, just do your best at sticking to the manual — it’s all part of the learning process!

[Circulate the room to be available if participants have questions but try to let them complete the task themselves. After the 10 minutes]

How was that? Was it hard? It will get easier with practice, that’s one of the goals of this training!

Let’s see what the scores should be and go through the elements one by one, look at the notes on your scoring sheet. Lesson Facilitation, which behaviors did you identify? CFU? Feedback? CT?

What did you score? Why?

[Allow participants to share & discuss. Go through all the elements to see which behaviors and scores the participants identified for each behavior element]

We will now have a quick activity. Which behavior in the area of Instruction do you think is the most difficult to observe and why?

# INSTRUCTION: GROUP ACTIVITY (5-7 minutes)

Activity Question:

Which behavior in the area of Instruction do you think is the most difficult to observe and why?

&gt; Achieve consensus on one behavior

Share it with the whole group

[Give small groups 5-7 minutes to discuss among themselves, try to visit each of the groups to see what they’re saying and if they need any help or clarification. After time is up ask for a volunteer to collect and tally the votes]

Ok, so the behavior with the most votes is ___ [insert behavior]. Would a group please share why they thought this was the hardest behavior?

# Assigning Element Scores

[5 mins]

I really appreciate the effort everyone is exerting to learn the tool! At this point, you have learned about the first seven elements as well as how to take notes and assign behavior quality ranges. Now we will introduce the last step, assigning element scores, and will practice it as we go through the final area of Socioemotional Skills.

Once you have assigned High, Medium, Low, or N/A for each of the behaviors in an element you will then assign a score for the element.

# TEACH: SCORING PROCESS

# ASSIGNING CODES

Mark L-M-H for each behavioral marker

Read manual and notes

Assign element score

So, you have assigned the behavior quality ranges, how do you come up with the final element score? For example, let’s say you have the following ranges for behaviors in an element: Medium, High, N/A, and High. What is the element score?

[Let participants answer. Use this as an opportunity to show them how N/A does not affect the score and to remind them to go back to the manual to decide which score is the best fit]

After you look at all the behavior quality ranges in an element, go back to the manual and read the overall description of the element that you think fits best. Assigning an element score is not simply a mathematical calculation. In the example I just mentioned, the final score would likely be a 4 as it has some aspects of Medium and some aspects of High, but it could also feasibly be scored a 5 if the overall segment best fits the description of a High. The most important thing is to return to the manual and see which description best fits the evidence you collected during the observation.

Does everyone understand? Let’s do a quick check, please give me a thumbs-up if you understand how to assign element scores, thumbs-down if you feel you’re missing something, and thumb-sideways if you think you get it, but you’re not confident.

[Check everyone’s answer, ask follow-up questions for those with thumbs-down, such as, “which part seems to be giving you trouble?”]

It is always challenging to learn something new, but I’m sure if we all make the effort to code according to the manual, and to put in the practice, we can all pass the Reliability Exam. That’s our main goal, but our goal for today is just to learn how to use the tool so don’t worry, we’ll get there.

[5 mins]

Moving on to the final area — Socioemotional Skills.

TEACH TME ON TASK QUALITY OF CLSSROO TEACHER CULTURE Eacup PRAcTICESC INSTRUCTION LLXD HDLD SOCIOEMOTIOMAL SKILLS

The Area of socioemotional skills has to do with how the teacher helps students develop autonomy, perseverance, and social and collaborative skills. The development of these skills is critical for learning, and also for life outside and beyond school. Thus, we want teachers to help students develop these skills as part of their education.

# 7. Autonomy

[20 mins]

Who can read the definition for Autonomy, on Page 29?

[A participant reads]

# C. SOGLQEMOTIONAL

# 8. AUTONOMY

The teacher provides students with opportunities to make choicesᵃⁿᵈ to take on meaningful roles in the classroom. Students make use of these opportunities by volunteering to take on rolesᵃⁿᵈ expressing their ideas and opinions throughout the lesson.

There are three behaviors, providing students with choices, providing them the opportunity to take roles in the classroom, and finally if students volunteer to participate in the classroom. Similar to 6.3, we again focus on students for the third behavior because it provides more evidence that there is a culture of autonomy in the classroom.

# C 7. AUTONOMY

# OBSERVER MANUAL

# 7.1

May we have a volunteer to read the first behavior? C 7, AUTONOMY

[A participant reads]

We do have a couple of FAQs for this behavior as well. May we have a volunteer to read the first one, 7.1a on Page 37?

[A participant reads]

Providing choices is one way to help students be more engaged and willing to learn. Note that the teacher must explicitly provide a choice. For example, perhaps we can see students are choosing which color pencil to write with; however, if the teacher did not explicitly say that they could choose which color pencil to use, we cannot consider this as evidence for this behavior.

And let’s read the second FAQ, another volunteer?

[A participant reads]

The difference between the Medium and High is whether the choice is related to the learning objective or not. To continue with the same example, choosing a color of pencil is likely not related to the learning objective — while choosing which method to use to solve an equation would be. Any questions?

Moving on to the next behavior.

# 7.2

May we have another volunteer? C 7, AUTONOMY

[A participant reads]

7.2 The teacher provides students with opportunities to take on roles in the classroom

What are some ways in which a student might take on roles in the classroom? What does that mean? Has anyone here had a role during the training today?

[Lead a discussion to help students identify roles and to differentiate between Medium and High]

As we said earlier, there are three behaviors in Autonomy — now let’s look at the last one.

# 7.3

A volunteer please? C 7, AUTONOMY

[A participant reads]

7.3 The students volunteer to participate in the classroom

The variation in behavior ranges for 7.3 has to do with the number of students in the class that volunteer to participate in the classroom. Let’s read the FAQ to see what counts as volunteering.

[A participant reads]

To obtain a High, most students must volunteer, most is considered more than 50%. You should estimate the proportion of students who volunteer across the whole class — if, for example, during the first question of the class all the students raise their hands to volunteer the answer, but then for the next three questions only 1-2 students raise their hands, we would not consider that most of the students volunteered and this would be scored a Medium.

Are there any questions?

TEACH TRAINING MANUAL 43

# TEACH TRAINING DAY 1 SCRIPT

Ok, that sums up Autonomy. Let’s watch a video. We will assign scores all together again as a group and this time, we will also assign the element score together.

[Play video] C 7. AUTONOMY: PRACTICE VIDEO

As this element is Autonomy, would anyone like to volunteer to lead our discussion? You may choose someone to be a recorder if you like.

[Invite a participant to lead the group in discussing what they observed and what scores they should assign]

What do you all think? Did s/he do a good job? Thank you for helping lead the group in sharing their ideas and discussing, let’s give a round of applause! Do we have another volunteer who would like to lead our discussion on the master codes, don’t worry, I will support with the discussion of the element scores since this is the first time we’ve done it?

[Invite another participant to lead a brief discussion on the evidence for the various behaviors seen in the video and the scores assigned (support with discussion of the element scores). If necessary, remind them to encourage others to share as much as possible and provide support where necessary to the participant leading the discussion]

Nice, we learned about autonomy and practiced it at the same time! Here’s our game scenario.

[Read from the slide: C GAME QUESTION 8]

“Has anyone ever divided something?” the teacher asks. A student shares an experience of dividing an apple with his friend. The teacher continues, “Yes, that is why it’s important for us to learn division, so you can use it in real life.” The teacher then writes a division problem on the board and asks for a volunteer to come solve the equation: Most students excitedly raise their hands. The teacher selects a student to come solve the equation on the board. Once she is finished the teacher asks her to explain to the class what she did:

Now for the next element — Perseverance.

# OBSERVER MANUAL

# 8. Perseverance

[20 mins]

Who can read the element definition?

[A participant reads]

# C. SOGLQEMOTIONAL

# 8. PERSERVERANCE

The teacher promotes students' efforts toward the goal of mastering new skills or concepts instead of focusing solely on results, intelligence, or natural abilities. In addition, the teacher has a positive attitude toward challenges, framing failure and frustrations as useful parts of the learning process. The teacher also encourages students to set short and/or long-term goals:

Thank you. This element has three behaviors, all of which are part of developing perseverance: The teacher focuses on students’ efforts, has a positive attitude towards challenges, and encourages goal-setting.

# 8.1

Would someone please read the description and behaviors for 8.1?

[A participant reads]

# C 8. PERSEVERANCE

1. The teacher acknowledges student efforts, rather than focusing only on results, student intelligence, or natural abilities.

# 8.2

The teacher has a positive attitude towards students' challenges.

# 8.3

The teacher encourages goal setting.

What do you think “student effort” means?

[Allow participants to share]

Who would like to read FAQ 8.1a?

[A participant reads]

So, really, anything a student does can be recognized as effort, even if it is not that challenging. Even your reading of the FAQ was a good effort so thank you!

Would someone please read the second FAQ, 8.1b?

[A participant reads]

Thank you. While this may seem similar to 1.2 (Positive Language) it’s quite different. Sometimes it helps to step back and remember in what element and area you are. Here, we are looking at how the teacher develops the socioemotional skill of perseverance. So, simply saying, “good job” which would count towards 1.2 does not really interest us here. We want the teacher to acknowledge the effort that the student has made. If the teacher doesn’t acknowledge any efforts, this is a Low; if the teacher sometimes focuses on efforts, but mostly praises outcomes or intelligence, this is a Medium; and if the teacher frequently and explicitly acknowledges student efforts this is a High.

So, 8.1 focuses on acknowledging student effort; 8.2 is about the teacher’s attitude towards student challenges.

8.2 Do we have anyone who has not yet read? Would you like to read?

[A participant reads]

8.2 The teacher has positive attitude towards student challenges

We have a few FAQs for this behavior. Who would like to read 8.2a?

Thank you. Here, any evidence of positive attitudes, like “nice try” would be enough to indicate a High provided there is no other evidence to the contrary; just saying wrong or right with no apparent frustration from teacher or encouragement to students would likely be a Medium; and any frustration, impatience, or indication of a negative attitude would be a Low.

[Lead a brief discussion on the evidence for the various behaviors seen in the video and the behavior and element scores assigned]

Here’s the scenario for our game.

The teacher acknowledges students' efforts (8.1: L): does not = The teacher shows neutral attitude towards students' challenges (8.2: M). There is some evidence the teacher encourages goal-setting: For example; when she does the analogy about the tree she talks about long-term goals by saying; "You are like a tree, your roots are like grades 1, 2 and 3. You should study hard your grades 1, 2 and 3. Then your roots will be strengthening you to turn to tree till grade 12. If you have proper upbringing; if you eat healthy; if you study hard then your roots will get stronger and then you can become an Engineer or doctor" (8.3: HJ: Element = 3.

# GAME QUESTION 10

[Read from the slide:] The teacher says, “Now you should each write your own sentence, you can write what you want as long as it is in the past tense.” The teacher circulates the classroom as the students work. When looking at one student’s sentence she says, “This is the present tense, what should you do to make it past?” To another student she says, “Good job! You got this wrong earlier, but you kept trying and your efforts have paid off.”

# Social and Collaborative Skills (SCS)

Who would like to read the definition?

[A participant reads]

Thank you, now let’s look at the three behaviors included in this element.

# Social & Collaborative Skills

The teacher encourages students' collaboration with one another and promotes students' interpersonal skills. Students respond to the teacher's efforts by collaborating with one another in the classroom, creating an environment free from physical or emotional hostility.

I will read this one. One, the teacher promotes collaboration through peer interaction. Two, the teacher promotes interpersonal skills. And three, students collaborate with one another. These are the final three behaviors we will be exploring. Almost there!

# 9. SOCIAL AND COLLABORATIVE SKILLS

The teacher promotes students' collaboration through peer interaction.

9.2 The teacher promotes students' interpersonal skills such as perspective-taking, empathizing, emotion regulation, and social problem-solving.

9.3 Students collaborate with one another through peer interaction.

TEACH TRAINING MANUAL 47

# TEACH TRAINING DAY 1 SCRIPT

# 9.1

Let’s read the first one.

C 9, SOCIAL AND COLLABORATIVE SKILLS

[A participant reads]

The teacher promotes students' collaboration through peer interaction.

This behavior is focused on the teacher providing opportunities for collaboration, not whether students actually collaborate with one another —the students actual collaboration will be captured under.

|     | The teacher does not promote | The teacher promotes   | The teacher promotes substantial |

A key distinction here is the difference between the Medium and the High, which boils down to whether the teacher promotes “superficial” or “substantial” student collaboration, is the definition of “substantial student collaboration.” As mentioned in the descriptions, “superficial” collaboration involves sharing opinions, materials, or ideas, whereas “substantial” collaboration involves getting students to work together to produce something, solve a problem, complete a worksheet, or present a new idea. Would anyone be able to provide an example showing this distinction? Perhaps you can think of some examples of when I have promoted collaboration today?

[A participant shares]

I know this is so much information, but you are all working really hard and have already made a lot of progress! Anyone know under which behavior that statement would be categorized?

[Allow participants to answer, acknowledging student effort — 8.1]

Let’s wrap up the final two behaviors, and then we can work on polishing everything until it feels smooth tomorrow. Up next is 9.2, the teacher promotes interpersonal skills.

# 9.2

This time, let’s do things a bit differently — I’ll start by reading the overall description for 9.2:

[Read the footnote]

Now let’s turn to the FAQ, which has some examples for each of these interpersonal skills. Can I have a volunteer to read the FAQ?

[A participant reads]

Thank you. Does anyone have any questions on any of these interpersonal skills?

Now that we understand better what Teach defines as interpersonal skills, let’s read the behavior ranges. Can someone please read these for me?

[A participant reads]

Thank you. So, for the High, the teacher promotes the students’ interpersonal skills, like in some of the examples we just read. In the Medium, there is some evidence that the teacher promotes interpersonal skills, but these are brief or superficial; for example, the teacher encourages children to take turns to participate in an activity, but the reasoning behind these actions are not acknowledged. In low there is no evidence of the teacher promoting interpersonal skills.

Now for the final behavior, 9.3.

# OBSERVER MANUAL

# 9. SOCIAL AND COLLABORATIVE SKILLS

# 9.3 May we have a volunteer?

[A participant reads]

This behavior is effectively focused on two aspects of the students: is there collaboration and is there negative behavior. To be scored High, there should be collaboration throughout the lesson as well as no instances of negative behavior. Even if the segment is full of collaboration, if there is significant negative behavior, this would still be scored Low. As in 9.1, student collaboration should be working together not only sharing pencils.

Any questions? Ok, let’s watch the SCS video and then work in our small groups to assign behavior and element scores.

[Play video]

# 9. SOCIAL AND COLLABORATIVE SKILLS: PRACTICE VIDEO

What did you observe?

[Allow participants to share & discuss in small groups. Groups should assign scores]

# So let us begin our group work

Who would like to share their scores with the group?

[Lead a brief discussion on the evidence for the various behaviors seen in the video and the scores assigned]

The teacher promotes students' collaboration by asking them to develop group activity (9.1: H) - The teacher encourages interpersonal skills by setting behavior expectation of "helping each other" prior to the group activity. She also tells students to "help out your leader" during the group activity. However, she does not encourage students displays of negative behavior: For example, students work in groups and wait patiently for their peers to get materials for the group activity (9.3: H)

Element = 4

Here’s the last piece of our game!

[Read from the slide:

During a lesson the teacher has students complete a work-sheet in pairs matching words to occupations. After students are finished he asks, “What do you want to be when you grow up?” One student says she wants to be a doctor and her class-mate says, “You can’t be a nurse, doctors are boys.” The teacher responds, “Anyone can be a doctor or nurse. Let’s remember to how our words might make others feel and speak kindly.”

# Socioemotional Skills Video

[15 mins]

OK, let’s watch the Socioemotional Skills area video, which includes Autonomy, Perseverance, and SCS. This time, please try to assign the behavior and elements scores by yourself and then we will discuss with one another after looking at the master codes.

[Play video]

Who would like to share their scores with the group?

# Discussion

[Lead a brief discussion on the evidence for the various behaviors seen in the video and the scores assigned]

The teacher provides students with choice that is embedded in the learning activity: Particularly; she indicates that students can write down any word that is a proper noun, which is directly related with the lesson: The teacher says, "Cut a small paper and write down proper noun: Not from those ones (pointing to the board)." So, let's think about other proper nouns. And let's write in little pieces of paper and then we'll raffle them to see which ones are the most popular proper nouns.

The most frequently chosen (7.1: H): The teacher does provide students with opportunities to take on roles in the classroom (7.2: not L): Students do not volunteer to participate in the classroom since they are doing group activity (7.3: L):

# Master Codes

Let’s see what the master codes are. Which part makes the most sense? Which part is still confusing?

[Lead a debriefing with the whole group about the video]

The teacher does not acknowledge students' efforts (8.1: L): The teacher shows neutral attitude toward students' challenges since she does not penalize them for making mistakes. For example, when she notices that one student made a mistake, she explains how to identify proper noun by paying attention to the use of capital letters: However, she does not help students understand failure and frustration as normal parts of the learning process (8.2: M).

The teacher does not encourage goal-setting (8.3: L): The teacher promotes students' expectation of "helping each other." She says, "colleague must help you. Talk to each other: Let's work together." However, she does not fully explain why it is important to help each other (9.2: M): There is consistent evidence of student collaboration in this video and no displays of negative behavior: For example, the students are working together during the group activity by discussing the proper nouns (9.3: H).

# WRAP-UP

[10 mins]

Those are all the components, areas, elements, and behaviors of the Teach tool! Thinking to your own classroom experience, either as a teacher or a student, does anyone have a short story they’d like to share from the classroom and which one of these behaviors or elements it fits into?

Nice work everyone! You have already come so far in your understanding of the tool and all its behaviors. We have gone over the introduction of the tool, procedures for coding, and spent quite a bit of time overviewing the entire tool — components, areas, elements, and behaviors. For each behavior you learned the definitions as well as how to identify behaviors, and we’ve practiced seeing what those behaviors actually look like in videos of classrooms. So now, let’s see who won our little game!

[Announce the winner/s and award the prize/s. Make sure the prizes are enough to be fun, but are small so that others do not get jealous]

You’ve learned so much today and I’m sure you are tired, so I hope you get good rest tonight. If you can, try to read through the manual tonight to keep things fresh — especially the sections you found most confusing. Tomorrow, we will be focusing on practicing coding full-length, or 15 min observations. Similar to what we did today, we will begin by coding in groups and then move to coding individually. Have a good night everyone!12

¹ If you have an hour or more at the end of the day you may move to the first practice video in the instructions for Day two.

# TEACH TRAINING DAY 2-5

# PRACTICE

Practice makes perfect. This section delves into the next phase of the Teach training — practice. For observers to pass the Reliability Exam and become certified Teach observers, they must have ample opportunity to practice coding reliably. This involves repeatedly coding segments and receiving feedback on what they did well and areas for improvement to internalize the nuances of the tool. Since Teach observations are conducted live, it is also critical to have enough practice to build fluency, so that observers can reliably complete coding within the allotted 10- to 15-minute time slot.

As part of the training, the Teach team recommends incorporating different types of practice. These different types of practice are effectively “scaffolding”, beginning by giving the participants a lot of guidance and support and then gradually removing that support so they can become reliable independent observers. You can use one type of practice more than once and should use your judgement in terms of how much scaffolding participants need. For example, provided there is sufficient time, it is ok to use Practice 2 a couple of times before moving onto Practice 3. Additionally, participants should have the opportunity to practice coding multiple videos individually before the Reliability Exam.

Below you will find information on the various types of practice, including sample scripts for introducing the different practice sessions to the participants. You will have already used some of these different types of practice with the short video clips in the Day 1 training. For all these practice sessions, you should have master codes and justifications printed out for each participant as well as PowerPoint slides for presenting the master codes. You will find sample master codes, justifications, and template slides in the Training Package.

Throughout the training, it is important to ensure participants have the opportunity to ask questions, share concerns, and make sure they are learning and practicing things in the correct way to build fluency. As every group/culture is different in terms of asking questions, sharing struggles, etc. be sure to use techniques that are appropriate for your audience. See the Collecting and Using Data section below for more information.

# Practice 1: Code as a Whole Group

The first stage of practice has the most support and the participants do not do any coding by themselves — everything is done as a whole group, under the guidance of the trainer. During this stage, everyone watches the video together, everyone discusses what they observed together, they assign behavior range scores together, and they assign element scores together. Nothing is done individually.

This type of practice provides participants with a lot of support as they are just learning to code and may forget important steps at first. Whole-group coding helps ensure that participants learn how to code the correct way from the beginning, and helps prevent them from forming bad/incorrect habits. While you may be tempted to skip this step to “save time” if your participants seem more advanced, this is an important step in becoming a Teach observer.
---
# PRACTICE

# Sample Script: Practice 1¹³

Now we will practice tying together everything that we have learnt so far with an activity. As a whole group, we will watch a video, take notes, discuss what we see, and practice assigning scores. Before we begin, let’s refresh ourselves on the correct coding procedures. Please turn to page 7 of the manual.

We will do a 15-minute observation to simulate a live observation. Try to take as many notes as you can that focus on providing evidence for the different behaviors.

Use a new observation sheet and try to push yourself to find a note-taking strategy that works for you. Note-taking is kind-of personal so there is some flexibility, but I encourage you to try to use the techniques mentioned in the manual such as using direct quotes, tally marks, abbreviations, and summaries.

We will take notes as we watch the video and then we will read the manual as we assign behavioral ranges first to all the behaviors and then scores to all the elements. Remember that the tool is the scoring sheet and the manual — you should never try to score without the manual.

After the video, we will work together as a whole group to discuss notes and compare them to the behavior ranges in the manual. Then, we will assign quality ranges to each behavior before looking at the element as a whole and assigning a final element score.

# CODING

For coding the three snapshots, you will need to keep track of time yourself. There is a one-minute window in which to take the snapshot. You should take a snapshot between minute 4-5, 9-10, and 14-15. For each snapshot remember to code if the teacher is providing a learning activity for most students or not. If so, scan the room and record how many students who appear off task.

When we are ready to assign scores for the remainder of the elements, remember to mark all the behavior scores. After assigning all the behavior scores, we should always assign the element score which fits best. For example, if the scores might be between 4 and 5, we will read both the Medium and the High and assign which one fits best. We should not assume that it is better to assign a 4 just because we may have two Mediums and one High — a 5 might be the best fit for the element. We will read the whole description and assign the score that is the best fit considering what we have observed.

# WATCH VIDEO

Alright, so let’s watch the video, take notes, and then we’ll discuss as a whole group. The video will be 15-minutes. Don’t worry, do your best and then we’ll work together to discuss and code after everyone is finished.

Please keep your phone or stopwatch to keep time for the time checks.

[Play video. After the video is over, discuss what the participants observed, and assign behavior and element scores as a whole group. Remember to use your tracker to make sure that as many participants as possible are engaged and understanding]

If you have more than an hour left at the end of Day 1 training, resume script here for first practice video. If you do use this script during the Day 1 training, at the beginning of Day 2 use some items from the quiz item bank to start with a quiz/activity to remind the participants of the procedures for coding.

# Practice 2: Code as a Small Group

encouraged to share their ideas and help other participants who may be struggling — sometimes hearing something phrased in a slightly different way from a peer may help the struggling participant understand.

# PRACTICE VIDEO

- Watch the video and take notes
- Identify constructs and organize notes without scoring
- Review notes and give feedback in pairs
- Whole group discussion

One day; the dog saw the cat wake 106 to clarify misunderstandings are all important roles of the trainer during the small group discussion.

In the next stage of practice, participants are afforded a little bit more independence as they begin to practice coding without guidance of the trainer throughout the whole process. Here, participants will discuss and code as a small group before sharing and discussing their scores with the larger group to make sure everyone understands and is aligned with the master codes. At this stage, participants gain experience in learning to justify which score they think is correct, and to provide supporting evidence for their scores from the video they saw.

The groups should be different from the groups used on the first day. After Day 1 of the training, you should arrange the participants in groups based on their performance, putting participants who seem to have a good understanding of Teach with participants who seem to need more support. This way, the participants can learn from one another. Participants with a better grasp of the tool may be.

# Sample Script: Practice 2

Everyone take a moment and think about which element and which behavior you are having most trouble with. Circle the element and the behavior on your score sheet (so you should make two circles). During the next video, pay a little bit of extra attention towards gathering evidence for the element and behavior that you are struggling with so you get some extra practice with the element and the behavior — but don’t forget to gather evidence for all the other elements and behaviors too!

# TEACH TRAINING DAY 2-5

For coding the three snapshots, you will need to keep track of time yourself. There is a one-minute window in which to take the snapshot. You should take a snapshot between minute 4-5, 9-10, and 14-15. For each snapshot remember to code if the teacher is providing a learning activity for most students or not. If so, scan the room and record how many students who appear off task.

When we are ready to assign scores for the remainder of the elements, remember to mark all the behavior scores. After assigning all the behavior scores, we should always assign the element score which fits best. For example, if the scores might be between 4 and 5, we will read both the Medium and the High and assign which one fits best. We should not assume that it is better to assign a 4 just because we may have two Mediums and one High — a 5 might be the best fit for the element. We will read the whole description and assign the score that is the best fit considering what we have observed.

Keep trying to take specific notes using the various tips and strategies we’ve discussed. I know it’s hard at first, but that’s why we are practicing!

We will do another 15-minute observation. Again, try to take as many notes as you can that focus on providing evidence for the different behaviors. After the video you will work together as small groups of three14 to discuss notes and compare them to the behavior ranges in the manual. You will assign scores, both for the behavior ranges and for the elements, with your group. We will take 45 minutes to assign scores, so you will need to watch and manage your time to make sure you get through all the behaviors and elements. I’ll let you know when the time is half-way through.

When you are ready to assign scores, remember we should assign the score which fits best based on the descriptions and examples in the manual. Always go back to the manual, read the whole description, and assign the score that is the best fit considering what we have observed.

Alright, so watch the video, take notes, and then sit in your groups of three to discuss notes and scores. The video will be 15 minutes and then you will have 45 minutes to discuss and assign scores. If it seems like not enough time don’t worry, do your best and then we’ll work together to debrief as a whole group after everyone is finished.

Ready?

[Play video. After the video is over, remind participants to assign behavior and element scores in their small groups. Actively monitor the room while participants are discussing, they will have 45 minutes and do give them time checks to help make sure they all code the entire video. After the 45 minutes are over consider having each small group write their master scores on the board for reference during discussion. Then, reveal the master codes and facilitate the whole group discussion. Call on specific groups during discussion based on the scores they wrote on the board. See example image below]

[After the discussion is over, collect the notes from participants on Practice 2. During Practice 3 video and coding session, spend some time looking at participant notes to see what participants are doing well and where participants are struggling. Share with them in the note-taking section in Practice 3 below]

# Practice 3: Code Individually, Small Group Discussion

As participants continue practicing the process of coding videos they become more confident and more reliable. As such, we continue to give them more independence so they continue to be challenged and are able to develop the ability to code on their own.

In this next stage of coding, participants will code individually before discussing their codes in small groups. After their small group discussions there will be a less-detailed whole-group discussion where you will be able to make sure any questions or concerns are adequately addressed. Have each small group record their final element scores on the board or on a piece of flip chart paper. Refer to these scores during the whole-group discussion so that you can spend less time on areas where there is more consensus (between groups).

Sample Script: Practice 3

Everyone is doing a great job! It’s okay if you still feel confused about some parts of the manual or coding procedure — this is a normal part of the learning process. Be sure to raise these issues within our whole group or small group discussions, to ensure that I or your colleagues can help you understand the process better, and this way we can all work together towards getting reliable on Teach!

If you notice that many of the participants are struggling with a certain behavior, element, or area, consider using a few questions from the item bank to facilitate a group discussion and help clarify misunderstandings.

# TEACH TRAINING DAY 2-5

Before we begin, how does everyone feel note-taking is going? Can we have a quick check? Give me a thumbs-up if you think you’ve found strategies that work for you, even if you feel you need some practice! A thumbs-sideways if some things are working, but you feel you’re still struggling to capture everything, or a thumbs-down, if you feel completely lost and that you need more ideas/tips to be able to successfully code.

[Allow participants to express their feelings on note-taking]

I have looked at your notes and I noticed that you are doing a great job on ____ and I think some of you could improve by ____.

[Use data from looking at their notes to provide specific feedback]

# 12 ASSIGN SCORES

We will now do another 15-minute observation. For the next video, you will practice assigning codes by yourself. We will give you 30 minutes to assign codes, please manage your time appropriately though I will let you know when you have 5 minutes left. If you finish early, consider going back and double checking, read the FAQs, etc. After you code all the behaviors and elements individually, you will have half an hour to discuss your codes as a small group. Try to focus on the behaviors where your group had the most variation in scores. Share your evidence with one another and try to come to a consensus on what you think the correct score should be. After your small group discussion, we will again share the master codes and have a whole-group debrief where you will have a chance to share any unresolved questions or share any insights from your discussions.

When assigning your scores, remember to always go back to the manual, read the whole description, and assign the score that is the best fit considering what we have observed. Also remember to assign a score to every behavior and every element, make sure you are writing all your answers in the far-right column on the score sheet.

Ok, here is the next video.

[Play Video. After the video is over, remind participants to assign behavior and element scores individually and to not look at other participants' paper. Give them 30 minutes to assign scores. Once the time is up, give them another 30 minutes to discuss in small groups and come up with a small group score. Actively monitor the room while individuals are coding and while participants are discussing. After groups are done discussing and have decided on their group scores, once again invite them to write their small group scores on the board. Once each group has written their scores on the board, reveal the master codes and have a whole-group debrief]

# 4 WORLD BANK GROUP
---
# PRACTICE: PRACTICE 4: CODE INDIVIDUALLY

For the final stage of practice, participants will go through the entire process individually. This gives them the opportunity to practice what it will be like during the Reliability Exam as well as helping them develop the confidence they will need to individually code in the field.

It is important to make sure the participants know that these scores will not have any bearing on the Reliability Exam and that they will not be panelized for incorrect answers — the scoresheets are simply for the purpose of helping identify areas in which participants may be struggling. As the master scores will be revealed while participants still have their scoresheets, do remind participants to not change their answers as wrong answers will help ensure areas in which they are struggling are addressed.

Participants will code individually. After they have finished coding, the master codes will be revealed and they will engage in whole group discussion. After the discussion, participants should turn in their score sheets — data from these score sheets should be entered into the Reliability Excel and pertinent notes added to the tracker to help identify areas where participants are struggling the most. Remind participants to make sure their name is on their scoresheet.

# Sample Script: Practice 4

In this final round of practice, you will experience what it will be like during the Reliability Exam. We will watch the video together, and then you will do all the coding individually. After you submit your codes, we will have another discussion together as a whole-group to go over any areas with lingering questions.

As always, focus on taking specific, evidence-based notes and consistently referring to the manual.

[Play Video. After the video is over, remind participants to assign behavior and element scores individually and to not look at other participants' paper. Give them 30 minutes to assign scores. Once the time is up, reveal the master codes and have a whole-group discussion. Remind participants to write their names on their scoresheets and to not change any scores after the master codes have been revealed. Remind them that there is no penalty for incorrect answers. Collect scoresheets at the end of the group discussion and input the data into the Reliability Excel. See who passed and who failed and make notes of your tracker]

# Practice 5: Coding in the Field16

In this section, you will learn how to set up the opportunity for participants to practice coding in the field, how to prepare the participants ahead of the field day, what to do on the day itself, as well as how to debrief afterwards.

Depending on the context of your training, debriefing may be able to take place the same day as field coding (preferable) or the following day. While the specific agenda of the field day may vary.

16 Field day is optional, include if relevant to the agenda for your training.
---
# TEACH TRAINING DAY 2-5

will depend on the context, you should always prepare partic- ipants for the field day and debrief afterwards. Depending on time, preparation may happen the day before and debriefing may be in the afternoon after observing classrooms or the next day.

Before making this a part of the training agenda, you should double check that schools are prepared to welcome the par- ticipants, and that you have the authorizations required to conduct observations at the school that you will be visiting as part of the training. Do not try to visit schools or conduct ob- servations if any of these aspects are not in place.

Participants should be assigned to groups ahead of time. There should be no fewer than 2 and no more than 4 partici- pants per class, and the number of participants per class will depend on the size of the training group as well as on the number of classrooms you have access to. It is important to create the groups strategically. Use data you have collected throughout the training to ensure groups have a mix of partic- ipants with stronger and weaker abilities. Again, this will ena- ble participants to learn from one another during the coding process and during the debrief.

# Sample Script: Practice 5 Procedures for Field Coding

Tomorrow17 you will be going into schools to conduct live observations of classrooms. You will observe the classrooms in small groups, but you will each code everything independently. After the experience, we will hold a debriefing session to go over any questions or concerns.

The goal of this section is to help you be as prepared as possible for going out into the field — this will be your first experience of conducting and coding live observation, which will be a very different experience from the video coding we have done so far. Let’s all turn to page 6 of the manual where we will find a lot of helpful information on protocol for conducting observations — which we will be doing soon!

You can see the Protocol is divided into three parts — Before, During and After. We are going to do a small activity to learn about these different protocols. I will divide you into three groups, one group will be “Before”, one group will be “During”, and one group will be “After.”18 Each group will be responsible for studying the protocol column assigned to you and creating a small skit to present to the rest of the group to teach us about the protocols in that section. For example, the Before group may create a small skit presenting one scenario where the teacher agrees to be.

17 Edit depending on agenda of the training.

18 Depending on the size of the group, consider dividing them into multiples of three groups. For example, 2 groups for Before, 2 for During, and 2 for After.

observed, and one where the teacher doesn’t. Does anyone have any ques-
tions? You will have 15 minutes to read your protocol section and think of a
small skit, then we will reconvene.

# DIVIDE GROUPS

[Divide the room into groups and assign them to a protocol section. Give them 10
minutes. Monitor the room, and provide assistance and ideas as necessary]

Ok great everyone. Now, we’ll go through the sections one by one, watch the
skit(s), and discuss that column before moving onto the next skit.

# WATCH SKIT

[Watch the skit on the Before protocol, discuss. Do the same with the two other sec-
tions.]

Thanks everyone for your participation! So, to wrap it all up, before the begin-
ning of the lesson, we should introduce ourselves to the teacher, explain the
purpose of the observation, and remind them that their identities will remain
confidential. If the teacher is out of the classroom and you have been given
permission to enter, find a place to sit and wait, and then go and introduce
yourself to the teacher when they enter.

Observers avoid interacting with their surroundings (the classroom, teacher, students, etc.) as much as possible
and sit quietly toward the back of the classroom. While conducting the observation we should be fully focused on
the class, even if seems like nothing is going on, this includes refraining from using our phones — except to monitor
time. We should also remember to maintain neutral body language and facial expressions throughout the observa-
tion. After the observation, make sure to thank the teacher, be respectful, and to not discuss the scores with anyone
except as requested by your supervisor.

# LENGTH OF OBSERVATION

Let’s take a look at the Length of Observation section on page 7. There is a
lot going on in classrooms and we have limited ability to pay attention to eve-
rything at once — there is a limited capacity of things one can recall and re-
member. That is why Teach observations are broken into two 15-minute seg-
ments, with time for coding after each segment. For example, in a 45-minute
lesson you’ll have 15 minutes of observation, then 15 minutes of coding, then
15 minutes of observation again and the last 15 minutes for coding, which may be done after the class is over. If
you know the class will only be 40 minutes then make sure to only spend 10 minutes coding the first segment to
ensure you are able to code two full, 15-minute observation segments. Right now, as we are learning, coding will
take more than 10-15 minutes, but with practice we will be able to do it within this time. While you’re in the field, if
you manage to code the first observation in less than the allocated time, make sure you only start the second
observation segment at the specified time — for example, if you manage to finish coding in 8 minutes when you
have 15 minutes to code, make sure to wait the full 15 minutes before beginning the second segment.

# Tablet Training

For participants who will be using tablets to submit their codes, they must be trained on using the tablets. The goal is to reduce user error and ensure all codes are entered correctly. In the Training Package you will find 5 completed observer sheets. These should be projected onto the screen and participants should all enter the scores into their tablet. Use the script for the optional activity below.

# Sample Script: Tablet Training

Now we will have a brief activity to practice entering scores into your tablets to record the information. It is critical that you know how to operate the system and that you carefully double check all the answers before submission to ensure quality data.

Please everyone go ahead and log-into the site on your tablet.

[Wait a moment to make sure everyone can access the site]

Is everyone on? Ok great, we will do one together first.

[Project a completed score sheet on the screen, walk participants through the data entry process and make sure any questions about each section are addressed]

Great, are you ready to do it on your own? I will now project 5 complete score sheets onto the screen, one at a time. You will have 15 minutes to enter the data for each scoresheet into your tablet. Make sure you are careful with your entries, so all the data is correctly recorded. If you have any questions, feel free to ask, this is not a test and we’re doing this to make sure you know how to correctly enter the data. That being said, do please ask me if you have a question and refrain from simply looking at your neighbor’s tablet.

Throughout the training, it is important to check for the participants’ understanding and to adjust the training as needed to ensure that the training meets the participants’ needs. In order to do this, you need to collect data to know what the observers are understanding and what they are not understanding. Some examples of effective checks for understanding have been built into the Day 1 Training Script, and more examples are provided below. However, checking for understanding is not enough — you must use the data to provide participants with additional support where necessary, in order to help them understand the manual and coding procedures so they can pass the Teach Reliability Exam.

# Effective Ways to Check for Understanding

- Ask direct questions — this can be a good way to check understanding of a few students, but it can be difficult to get at most student’s understanding.
- Randomly select names — to ensure all participants have the chance to participate, consider writing everyone’s name on a piece of paper and putting it in a box. When it’s time to ask a question, draw a name and call on the participant.
- Tracker Sheets: Trainer — make notes of the areas/elements/behaviors that often come up in discussions.
- Tracker Sheets: Participant — have a dedicated tracker sheet for each student. It should have a place where they can set a goal for each day, write questions, and indicate areas they understand and areas where they are confused.
- Thumbs-up, thumbs-down — this activity may be used as a quick way to check if participants agree or disagree with a statement. For example, you could give a scenario, say it was given a High for a specific behavior and ask if participants agree or disagree (thumbs-up, thumbs-down). Alternative — consider having participants close their eyes while they do it to keep them from influencing each other’s answers.
- Raise your hand to yes/no questions — make sure to ask both the yes and no side of the question to help force people to choose one and not simply opt out. Alternative — If more than yes/no consider having participants raise a number of fingers to correspond with different answers (no more than three), for example, give a scenario and ask participants to “score” it as Low (1 finger), Medium (2 fingers), or High (3 fingers).
- Have participants discuss a question in pair or small groups and then share their answers with the group.
- Have all the elements/behaviors listed on the board or flip chart paper. Ask participants to put an X by the elements/behaviors in which they feel least confident. This provides a nice visual for areas of further discussion.

All the best CFUs may not lead to increased learning on the part of the students if there is no adjustment on the part of the trainer. Knowing participants are confused is not enough, you should use the information to identify and address areas of confusion.

A quick raise-the-hand question may show you that most people have not grasped a specific concept. Adjusting may be as simple as taking the time to re-explain that concept. Tracker Sheets are another way to keep track of the information received from the CFUs to assess where participants may be struggling and to provide additional resources, training, or practice surrounding those areas of confusion or difficulty. The Reliability Excel can also be used to input data from practice videos and get a feel for where participants are struggling the most.

TEACH TRAINING MANUAL 9

# TEACH TRAINING DAY 2-5

In the Training Package of this training manual you will find The Tracker Sheet: Participant is an additional resource to help them identify areas of confusion, pose questions, and reach goals. It may be especially helpful for participants who do not feel as comfortable asking questions during the training even though they may not understand. Make sure to ask participants to turn in their tracker sheets at the end of each day.

You will also find sample Tracker Sheets in the Training Package. One is for you, the trainer and one for the participants. On the Tracker Sheet: Trainer, there is a space by each participant name to make note of items such as: their participation in class, a space for notes (areas of strength or weakness), and space for recording the results of their practice codes. Collecting this information will help you adjust during the training, but also help provide you with valuable information as you form groups for conducting practice videos and the field training day.

# COMMON AREAS OF CONFUSION

While collecting and using data collected from the participants in the training should be your primary source of adjusting, we have found there are some common areas of confusion. The below outlines each element, various troublesome points for each, and how to best help participants overcome those points and become reliable with the tool.

# Time on Task

# Terms

While many of the terms used in the Teach Manual might be clear to some trainees, others may need additional explanation to clarify uncertainty:

- “Snapshot” — A moment which can last 1-10 seconds in which it is recorded what is happening. The length of the snapshot may vary depending on how long it takes to look around the room and count potentially “off task” students.

# Explanation

The Time on Task element was not included in previous training pilots.

# Troublesome Points

- 0.1 — There is no data for this behavior

# When to code

Look at the manual for instructions on when to code this behavior for a 15-minute segment. For a longer segment, code every 5 minutes. For example, in a 20-minute segment, the first snapshot should be between minutes 4 and 5, the second between minutes 9 and 10, and the this between minutes 14 and 15 and the last one between minutes 19 and 20.

# Snapshot window

While coders have a minute “window” in which to take their snapshot, they should avoid waiting for a learning (or non-learning) activity to occur to take their snapshot. The purpose of the window is to provide flexibility for the observer to finish writing notes and to avoid missing the snapshot altogether.

# COMMON AREAS OF CONFUSION: TIME ON TASK

Scan the room

Remind observers to scan the entire room during the time of the snapshot. It is important to locate the teacher before scanning the room. After locating the teacher, scan the room from left to right and note if the students are provided a learning activity. For example, are the students given a worksheet? Or are students waiting for the next activity?

Transitions

Transition time, or ‘waiting time’, is considered a non-learning activity. Transitions occur in most classes. As indicated in the manual, one should consider what most of the students are doing and if the teacher is providing a learning activity. A transition officially ends when most students are provided with the next learning activity.

Student distractions

It is important to note that students may get distracted throughout their work; this does not affect the score for 3.1 as this behavior is measuring if the teacher has provided students with a learning activity or is teaching, not if students apply themselves.

Tip— Look for visual and auditory cues. For example, if the teacher gives students a learning task and then proceeds to write on the board, even if students appear to be distracted this would be considered a learning activity. If most students appear to be finished and are waiting for another activity, this is considered a non-learning activity.

0.2 — There is no data for this behavior

For this behavior, the thresholds are provided in the manual.

How to determine on vs. off task

Trainees may have a difficult time determining which and how many students are on and off task. The manual provides some examples of what off task behaviors look like. In general, students are considered “off task” if they’re looking away, playing with other students, possibly fidgeting (they’re looking down, playing with their pencil, etc.), looking at the camera, talking to one another, etc.

Note — if 3.1 is scored No, 3.2 is scored N/A.

Students are considered off task when they are working on activities other than the one provided by the teacher. Some of these off task behaviors include talking to/playing with other students, sleeping, looking away from the board/wherever the teacher has directed their attention, and looking at the observer.

Tip— Start with the teacher and scan the room from left to right counting how many students appear to be off task for this behavior. Count the number of students that seem disengaged or distracted.

# Guiding Questions

Has the teacher provided the class with a learning activity?

0.1 Does this learning activity involve the majority of the class?

Is the teacher in the classroom while the students work on a learning activity

Showing trainees how behaviors play out in a real classroom can be very helpful to influence their thinking. Consider giving the following examples to help guide trainees thinking.

# COMMON AREAS OF CONFUSION: TIME ON TASK

# Philippines

In this snapshot, the class is forming groups for a learning activity the teacher has provided. Most of the students are slowly gathering materials and looking around. The students are off task because they are not participating in the learning activity provided.

# Punjab

The teacher is simplifying fractions on the board for the students. However, there is a group of 7 boys talking amongst themselves. The students are working in partners to match pictures with words that describe them. However, one of the pairs is finished and is not given any other learning activities.

# Time on Task FAQs

# (0.1a) When the class is in transition, how do I know when the transition has ended?

Transitions occur in most classes; as indicated in the manual, one should consider what most of the students are doing and if the teacher is providing opportunities to learn. A transition officially ends when most students are provided with the next learning activity. For example, if the teacher says, “Take out your workbooks and complete the exercise on page 3”, but students have not yet taken out their workbooks at the time of the snapshot, this would still be considered a learning activity as the teacher has provided a learning activity for most students. However, the students may be off task.

# (0.1b) How we would code the snapshot if a learning activity happens concurrently with administrative activities?

Even though the teacher is doing administrative tasks (which are considered non-learning activities), it would count as a learning activity if most students are provided with a learning activity. For example, while taking attendance, a teacher may ask children to identify phonemes and put their names on the wall under the first letter of their name.

# (0.2) Is a student off task if s/he leaves the room during the snapshot?

They are counted as off task. If they leave the room before your snapshot, you do not count them as off task.

# TEACH TRAINING DAY 2-5

# Supportive Learning Environment

# Terms

While many of the terms used in the Teach Manual might be clear to some trainees, others may need additional explanation to clarify uncertainty:

- “Respectfully” — It is recognized that “respect” can be demonstrated in different ways in different cultures. All students should feel welcome and the teacher should create an environment that is free from physical and emotional hostility. For example, in many countries using someone’s name is a sign of respect; however, this form of respect could manifest differently in different settings.
- “Positive language” — Positive language can be anything verbal that is used to praise or encourage a student or group of students.
- “Student needs” — Needs encompass any physical, material, or emotional needs of a student. This generally does not refer to a students’ academic “need” to understand content, but rather includes scenarios such as a teacher providing a student with a pencil, a partner for an activity, consoling a student who is crying, or accommodating students’ who need to use the bathroom, etc.

# Explanation

Based on evidence from prior trainings, trainees reliably scored SLE 89% of the time. Coders were less reliable on behaviors 1.1 (Medium) and 1.3 (Low and High). The behaviors trainees found most difficult are outlined below20:

# Troublesome Points

1.1 — Trainees are more likely to correctly score this behavior when it is a Low or a High, but when the score is a Medium only 34% score correctly; 12% incorrectly score it Low and 54% incorrectly score it High.

Medium score

This behavior is scored a Medium when the teacher does not ridicule, yell, or show impatience with students. It may be helpful to remember that if the teacher does not consistently or explicitly treat students with respect or disrespect, this behavior is scored a Medium.

# Concept of respect

The concept of respect varies from culture to culture and teachers may exhibit respect differently. As every culture is different, trainees should note whether or not the teacher treats students with disrespect or creates a hostile environment.

Tip— It is a good idea to explicitly mention that the teacher may receive a score of High on this behavior even if they don’t use student names. This can be a sticking point as some think it’s required to have a High score.

20 Comparative percentages data was taken from the combined reliability scores from the Punjab, DC, and UVA trainings. It is fully recognized that data may be biased as trainees may change their scores to help them pass the certification exam (i.e. coding a 2 when they think should score a 1 to give themselves a “buffer” as reliable is defined as scoring within 1 value of the master code). Note that the manual has changed for 1.1 and 1.4 since the trainings.

14 WORLD BANK GROUP
---
# COMMON AREAS OF CONFUSION: SUPPORTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT

Tip — Watch students’ reactions and how they respond to the way the teacher is treating them. While this alone may not be enough to evidence a score, it can help provide supporting evidence.

Tip — Engage the trainees in a discussion of what would constitute respectful and disrespectful teacher behavior in the classrooms they will be observing.

# Biases

Remind trainees to attempt to keep all personal biases out of their scores. This behavior may be easily affected by whether or not an enumerator “likes” the teacher or “feels badly” for the teacher. Lower or higher scores should not be given for reasons such as, “the teacher just seems kind of mean”, or “the teacher seems nice.”, respectively. Evidence should relate to what the teacher is saying and doing to show that they are respectful or disrespectful towards students.

Multiple rounds of scoring with the same teacher may also particularly increase bias in this behavior as trainees already have a preconceived notion of a teacher (as they have already given a score).

Tip — Have trainees ask themselves, “Would I still think this score is accurate if I hadn’t already seen this teacher?” Acknowledging the potential bias instead of pretending it doesn’t exist can help trainees be more objective.

# Automatic low

For this behavior, even if a teacher is treating students respectfully most of the time, if at any point she or he yells at, scolds, shames/ridicules, or uses physical punishment with students, the score is automatically a Low.

# 1.2 — Trainees generally do well with this behavior

# Positive language

Remember that this behavior is in the context of SLE and the goal is to measure how effective the teacher is at creating a supportive learning environment. Positive language can be anything to support a student. It is most often observed as an acknowledgement of something they did well (e.g., “Good job!”). However, it can also be encouraging students (e.g., “Try again, you can do it!”) or supporting them in general (e.g., “You have improved so much this year”).

# Positive actions

Things that may be positive but are not verbal are not considered evidence towards this behavior. For example, a teacher puts stars under students’ names on the board for those who are doing a good job, hands out stickers as a reward for getting a correct answer, or claps for a student. If these are accompanied by a verbal statement (e.g., “Let’s clap for John,”) then the statement is considered evidence towards this behavior although the actual clapping is not.

Note — that saying “Correct” is not evidence of positive language, as it is simply stating a fact.

# Quantify Low, Medium and High

How do we quantify the difference between Low, Medium, and High? Trainees will likely
---
# TEACH TRAINING DAY 2-5

see teachers using positive language such as “good” or “well done.” For generic positive language such as this, the general thresholds are as follows:

- Zero instances of positive language is scored a Low
- One to four instances of positive language is scored a Medium
- Five or more instances of positive language is scored a High
- If the positive language is very thoughtful, specific, and is of a higher quality than simply saying “Well done” the above rubric does not need to be rigidly followed. This type of language is scored a High.

1.3 — Trainees are more likely to correctly score this behavior when it is a Medium, High, or N/A, but when the score is a Low only 5% score correctly; 9% incorrectly score it Medium, 5% incorrectly score it High, and 81% incorrectly score it N/A.

# Teacher questions not as evidence

There may be instances when the teacher asks students if there is a need, such as “Are you hungry? Are you tired?” The teacher’s question is not considered as evidence toward this behavior and does not impact the score if the students do not give some indication that there is indeed a need (by answering “yes”, nodding their heads, keeping their head down on the desk, etc.).

# Teacher responses as evidence

If the teacher responds to a student need (and there is evidence to support that it is indeed a need), this can be considered evidence for this behavior even if the students do not say they have a need. For example, a student clearly does not have a partner during a partner activity. The teacher notices and has the student join a group of two other students so that all students are included.

Note — When there is a need that the teacher doesn’t respond to (score is Low), trainees tend not to notice the student need (they score as N/A).

1.4 — There is not data for this behavior

# Non-evidence

While being treated with equal regard means students should be provided with equal opportunities to engage in the class, a teacher who calls 4 boys and 3 girls to answer a question is not necessarily exhibiting evidence of gender bias.

Tip— if the teacher only calls two (or a low number) students and they both happen to be boys (or girls), this is not necessarily evidence of gender bias. When the number of students participating is quite low, it is reasonable that the teacher may not choose exactly an equal number of boys and girls.

# Girls over boys

Gender bias can happen in either direction. For example, if a teacher calls on only girls to
---
# COMMON AREAS OF CONFUSION: SUPPORTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT

answer hard questions, makes statements about excluding boys, or only gives girls the opportunity to participate in class then this is also considered evidence of gender bias.

High score

Remember that this behavior is scored a high only if the teacher does not exhibit gender bias AND challenges gender stereotypes. The teacher can challenge stereotypes by providing examples of families where the father-figure cares for the children while the mother-figure is a doctor. Another example of challenging gender stereotypes may come in the form of reading a book where the main character is a woman astronaut or a male dancer.

# Guiding Questions

Does the teacher, ignore, scold, or yell at students at any point?

# 1.1

Does the teacher exhibit any respectful behaviors towards the students?

What are examples of respectful behaviors that the teacher should exhibit towards the students?

What type of positive language does the teacher use? How specific and thoughtful is it?

# 1.2

How many times does the teacher use positive language?

What are some examples of student needs that you have seen?

# 1.3

If a teacher asks whether a student has a need, is there observable evidence that the student does indeed have a need?

What are some examples of what would constitute gender bias?

Are the chances to participate proportionate to the ratio of different genders in the classroom?

# 1.4

Does the teacher reinforce gender stereotypes in the classroom for any gender?

Does the teacher have different behavioral or academic expectations for different genders?

Does the teacher assign different types of roles to the different genders?

One student tells the teacher that she could not do the work because she does not have a pen. The teacher responds by saying, “Did you lose your pen? One should not forget a pen!” and moves on.

The teacher notices that one of the students has a temperature and says that he should be taken to the hospital soon. As the student does give visual indication that he is indeed sick, she, therefore, responds to the need, but the problem isn't resolved.

In a paired activity, the teacher notices that some students don’t have partners, so he reshuffles some students so that all have pairs. This is a student need as the students were required to be in pairs in order to complete the activity.

# Philippines

The teacher says to a student who is resting his head on a desk and closing his eyes, "Are you not feeling well?" and then goes to the student’s seat to check in by saying "Do you feel sleepy?" However, the teacher then continues with the lesson without further action.

During a group activity the teacher approaches a student sitting in front who didn't have a group and was not participating in the activity. The teacher speaks with the student and helps the student join a group and engage in the activity. Although the student’s specific need is inaudible, from visual cues the teacher is observed to address the issue.

# Afghanistan

During the reading exercise the teacher notices a student is not engaged and without a book. The teacher puts the book in-between the student and another student to the right and says, "Read together from textbook, read together."

# China

When a student is giving a response on the board, the teacher notices that the student is nervous and says, "Let’s encourage him. He’s too nervous. Just, relax, you’re great!"

The classroom appears roughly equal between boys and girls. The teacher does call on both to answer questions. At one point in the class, the teacher needs more chalk and sends a girl to fetch more. At another point he needs a cloth to clean the board and again sends a girl.

# Philippines

In a class of more girls, the teacher gives more opportunities to boys than to girls even though the girls raise their hands and are sitting close. The teacher only calls on boys to come up to the board and only calls on a few girls to answer simple, “yes/no” questions.

The teacher shows students photos of women working in construction and men staying at home, which challenges students to re-examine traditional gender roles.

# Supportive Learning Environment: FAQs

# (1.1) Must teachers use student names to treat students respectfully?

In some cultures, the use of names may not be a common sign of respect. If the teacher does not use names but exhibits other signs of respectful behavior (e.g., the teacher uses terms of endearment to refer to the students, uses a respectful form of a word, or speaks to the students in a warm tone of voice), this may still be scored high.

# (1.2a) Would nonverbal communication be counted as positive language?

Although praise for students may come in many forms, behavior 1.2 only seeks evidence of “positive language.” As such, nonverbal communication, such as clapping or smiling, would not impact the overall score. However, if the teacher makes a statement, such as “Let’s give a round of applause,” this would be counted toward positive language — not because of the applause, but because the teacher verbally communicates positive language.

# (1.2b) What is considered “consistent” positive language? Specifically, where do you draw the line between mid- and high-level?

Both the consistency and the quality of the comments should be taken into consideration. For example, if a teacher simply says, “you are such a talented group of students” and “awesome!” in a 20-minute segment, it is weighted more heavily than the teacher saying “good” four times. However, if the teacher says, “very good” seven times, this would constitute a high rating. The basic thresholds of 0 instances of positive language constitutes a low score, 1-4 a medium score, and at least 5 a high score, may be used as a loose guide to determine scoring.

# (1.3a)

A student needs to go to the bathroom, is that considered a need?

Yes, although the examples in the manual have to do with providing materials or emotional support, please remember that these are simply examples and are not comprehensive. Any observable emotional, material, or physical needs would be captured here. If a student needs to go the bathroom, that could affect how s/he pays attention during the class, and it is important for the teacher to address. It’s important to note, what’s not captured is a student’s need to understand academic content as this is captured when the teacher adjusts the lesson (behavior 4.3).

# (1.3b)

During a partner activity, the teacher rearranges partners to include a student without a partner. Does this count as responding to a student need?

Yes, although rearranging students in the classroom is not automatically considered responding to student needs, if a student doesn’t have a partner or group for an activity and the teacher rearranges the students to include the student, then this is considered to be addressing a student need. In order for this to count, there would need to be an identifiable student need — e.g., the student would either have to visibly not have a partner, or the teacher might say, “Who doesn't have a partner?”, and the student would need to respond that they do not have a partner.

# (1.3c)

Does asking a student if s/he has a specific need automatically count as responding to a student need?

No, a teacher simply asking if a student has a need does not necessarily count as responding to a student need. For example, if the teacher asks students if they are hungry or tired in an attempt to engage students, this would not automatically count as responding to a student need. However, this would be scored medium if the student indicates the perceived need does indeed exist by indicating if s/he is tired or hungry, or if it is clear that the student is tired or hungry. If the teacher then addresses the problem by giving the student something to eat, this would be scored high.

# Positive Behavioral Expectations

Terms

While many of the terms used in the Teach Manual might be clear to some trainees, others may need additional explanation to clarify uncertainty:

- “Positive student behavior” — Positive behavior typically aligns with or exceeds behavioral expectations.
- “Misbehavior” — A misbehavior occurs when a student causes a disruption in the classroom that either interferes with the flow of the lesson, distracts other students, or upsets the teacher.
- “Expected behavior” — What students are expected to do in classroom setting. Behavioral expectations focus on the expected behavior during an activity, whereas instructions for an activity focus on the steps required to complete an activity.

# Explanation

Based on evidence from prior trainings, trainees reliably scored Positive Behavioral Expectations 92.6% of the time. Coders were less reliable on behaviors 2.2 (Medium) and 2.3 (Medium). The behaviors trainees found most difficult are outlined below.21

# Troublesome Points

2.1 — Trainees generally do well with this behavior

Broad expectations

This behavior is scored Medium if the teacher sets unclear or superficial behavioral expectations. The teacher may set broad expectations, such as, “Use your manners.” This does not clarify or explain what “manners” entails, so it is scored Medium. This contrasts with a Low, in which no behavioral expectations are set.

Instruction vs. expectation

It is important to note that the example provided in the manual for 2.1 Low, “Work on your reading comprehension skills” is a vague instruction for an activity and not a behavioral expectation.

Note: Behavioral expectations do not necessarily need to be stated at the beginning of a segment; they can be clarified throughout the class when needed.

Setting expectations vs. redirecting

Remember the difference between setting clear behavioral expectations and redirecting misbehaviors. Setting clear behavioral expectations is proactive and informs the students about how they are expected to behave in class or for specific classroom activities. Redirecting misbehavior happens as the teacher reacts to misbehavior. After the redirection, the teacher may again remind the students of the behavioral expectations.

21 Comparative percentages data was taken from the combined reliability scores from the Punjab, DC, and UVA trainings. It is fully recognized that data may be biased as trainees may change their scores to help them pass the certification exam (ie. coding a 2 when they think should score a 1 to give themselves a “buffer” as reliable is defined as scoring within 1 value of the master code).

22 WORLD BANK GROUP

# COMMON AREAS OF CONFUSION: POSITIVE BEHAVIORAL EXPECTATIONS

# 2.2

Trainees are more likely to correctly score this behavior when it is a Low or a High, but when the score is a Medium, only 33% score it correctly; 62% incorrectly score it Low and 5% incorrectly score it High.

# Recognizing acknowledgement

Trainees often miss the teacher acknowledging students’ behavior (i.e. distinguishing between Low and Medium). Some examples of acknowledging student behavior at the Medium level are, “These children are working nicely together,” “Everyone should behave like this group,” and, “Group 1 is working well.”

# Medium vs. High

It is important to note the key criterion that distinguishes a Medium from a High is the specificity of the acknowledgement and not the number of acknowledgments.

# Effort vs. behavior

There may be some confusion between acknowledging positive behavior and acknowledging students’ efforts (8.1 Perseverance). Positive behavior typically refers to appropriate classroom behaviors that align with the teacher’s expectations and contribute to the classroom environment. Examples of positive behavior are when students sit quietly in their chairs, when students are paying attention while the teacher is talking, when students are on task, etc.

# 2.3

Trainees are more likely to correctly score this behavior when it is a Medium, High, or N/A, but when the score is a Low only 5% score correctly; 9% incorrectly score it Medium, 5% incorrectly score it High, and 81% incorrectly score it N/A.

# Tips — use the following chart to help with scoring:

| Redirection is ineffective                                           | Redirection is effective |        |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------ |
| Teacher redirects misbehavior, but focuses on the undesired behavior | Low                      | Medium |
| Teacher redirects misbehavior, and focuses on the expected behavior  | Medium                   | High   |
| No misbehaviors are observed                                         | High                     | High   |
| If the teacher does not redirect behavior at all                     | Low                      | Low    |

# Guiding Questions

Does the teacher set behavioral expectations at all? (Note: this can be at any time of the class)

Are there any observed misbehaviors?

# 2.1

Are these expectations clear and easy for students to follow step by step? Are students able to understand and know how they should behave from the expectations the teacher sets?

Does the teacher set behavioral expectations for the whole class before the start of an activity or does the teacher simply react towards students’ misbehavior during the activity?

Does the teacher acknowledge positive student behavior at all?

# 2.2

If so, is the acknowledgement specific and clear enough for students to know for what they are recognized?

Are there misbehaviors in class?

# 2.3

If so, does the teacher deal with that?

If so, does the teacher effectively redirect students’ misbehavior by focusing on expected behavior or their undesired behavior?

| 2.1 Mozambique   | The teacher does not set behavioral expectations. Because there is misbehavior, it is not assumed that routines are well-established. For example, when students are talking during a silent activity, the teacher says: “Can you stay quiet without talking or writing anything?” This is an example of misbehavior. | The teacher sets some superficial behavioral expectations. For example, the teacher says, “Can you please pay attention to the board?” and “When I am explaining something you should be paying attention.” However, these behavioral expectations are not clearly defined, and as there is misbehavior, it cannot be assumed that routines and expectations are well established. | The teacher sets clear behavioral expectations throughout the segment. For example, the teacher calls on a student to read and says, “Stand up. Read this aloud so the class can hear you.” Additionally, the students are well-behaved throughout the segment and so it is assumed that behavioral expectations have been clearly established. |
| Philippines      | The teacher does not set clear behavioral expectations throughout the lessons' various classroom tasks and activities. The teacher makes some comments about student behavior, but it is to redirect students’ misbehavior and not set behavioral expectations.                                                       | The teacher sets some behavioral expectations throughout the lesson, but most are superficial in nature and do not clearly indicate what the students are supposed to do.

| Punjab           | The teacher does not set any behavior expectations during the segment. Additionally, many students seem confused about how they should behave when they finish an assignment.

# 2.2 Philippines

There is no evidence of the teacher acknowledging student behavior that meets or exceeds expectations. The students are doing many things well, such as raising their hands, participating in classroom activities, and answering questions. However, the teacher does not take any notice of these efforts. The teacher acknowledges students’ positive behavior, but it is general and does not indicate for which behavior they are being praised. For example, the teacher says, “Very good Group 2” when they are sitting down after an activity. However, this does not specify what the students are doing well. The teacher also says, “Very good Group 1. They’re all sitting down properly” and “Group 1 is doing well. Their desks are clean.”

# Mozambique

The teacher does not acknowledge student behavior that meets or exceeds expectations. Students are well behaved throughout the class, but she does not acknowledge their good behavior. The teacher acknowledges some students’ positive behavior, for example, “You are behaving well today,” but this is superficial and does not mention expected behavior. Although this is brief and only happens once, the teacher is specific in pointing out what the child is doing correctly and acknowledging behavior that meets or exceeds expectations.

# Vietnam

There is some evidence of the teacher acknowledging positive student behavior. The teacher says, "You are doing well in pairs and big groups." The teacher does acknowledge some positive behavior but is not specific about what exactly they did well. The teacher praises a student by saying, “By checking the former lesson, I can see that you have reviewed the lesson and prepared for the new lesson. I would like to praise you.” This comment is about a specific positive behavior that meets or exceeds expectations.

# COMMON AREAS OF CONFUSION: POSITIVE BEHAVIORAL EXPECTATIONS

# 2.3 Philippines

The teacher does provide redirection for the students, but it does not focus on the expected behavior and it is not effective. For example, the teacher says, "Don't bother them." This comment is ineffective as students continue to walk about the room.

The teacher redirects students who are misbehaving by focusing on the expected behavior. For example, the teacher shows a student to their seat and says, "Sit down here." In addition, the redirection seems to be effective. While the students are somewhat loud while they are working with the whiteboards, the teacher has set it up as a game and their behavior is appropriate for the task at hand, as evidenced by the teacher's behavioral expectations.

# Afghanistan

In general, the students are well-behaved during the lesson. There are some moments when the teacher redirects misbehavior by focusing on expected behaviors. For example, the teacher says: "Listen," "Pay attention," and “Please put down your hands,” when the students are talking and reading the textbook.

# Philippines

The teacher is ineffective at redirecting misbehavior. When the teacher repeatedly tries to get students to return to their seats, the students ignore this and continue to roam around the classroom. The teacher also only focuses on misbehaviors such as the students failing to listen to directions and walking around the classroom.

# TEACH TRAINING DAY 2-5

# Positive Behavioral Expectations: FAQs

# (2.1) How are behavioral instructions different from directions or instructions for an activity?

Behavioral expectations focus on the expected behavior during an activity, whereas instructions for an activity focus on the steps required to complete an activity. For instance, the teacher may provide instructions for an activity by saying, “Read the first paragraph and then answer the questions on page 12” - this tells students what they need to do to carry out the activity. On the other hand, the teacher may provide behavioral instructions by saying, “If you have any questions, quietly raise your hands” - this sets clear behavioral expectations for the students to follow during the activity.

# (2.3) A student was sleeping in class, but I know he was up all-night working. The teacher seems sympathetic towards him and is letting him sleep. Does this affect the score?

There are two issues here. First, observers need to be very careful to not let any outside information influence their coding. No matter what the reason, only code and score what is observed during the coding segment. The second issue is the definition of misbehavior. Two factors may be considered when deciding if the student is misbehaving: if the student is causing a disruption in the classroom (distracting students who are trying to pay attention to the lesson), AND if the teacher is bothered by this disruption. If neither the teacher nor the other students are bothered by the student sleeping and it is not disruptive to the flow of the lesson, the behavior 2.3 score could still be high, depending on the other evidence in the classroom.

# COMMON AREAS OF CONFUSION: LESSON FACILITATION

# Lesson Facilitation

# Terms

While many of the terms used in the Teach Manual might be clear to some trainees, others may need additional explanation to clarify uncertainty:

- “Lesson objective” — This is the learning goal the teacher wants their students to accomplish from a given lesson. The learning goal should be specific and concrete, for example, “We are going to learn how to subtract double digits.” However, if the teacher says, “Today, we are going to learn about family,” this is not considered a lesson objective.
- “Content knowledge” — This refers to the students’ knowledge of lesson content, which students could have learned in this or other class.
- “Meaningfully connects” — Connections are meaningful when the teacher intentionally and explicitly draws a link between prior content knowledge and/or students’ daily lives and the lesson objective.
- “Learning activity” — This includes any activity that is related to class content, independent of its quality. For example, learning activities can include, but is not limited to, a teacher lecturing, small group/team work, or students working on a worksheet independently.
- “Models” — An action is considered modeling when there are procedures and/or thinking processes related to the learning activity that the teacher demonstrates/enacts for students to follow and emulate.
- “Thinking aloud” — Think-alouds take place when the teacher verbally walks students through each step of a thinking process. For example, …. If the learning activity focuses on developing a thinking skill, a complete model will include a think aloud.

# Explanation

Based on evidence from prior trainings, trainees reliably scored Lesson Facilitation 97% of the time. Coders were less reliable on behaviors 3.4 (High). The behaviors trainees found most difficult are outlined below.²²

# Troublesome Points

3.1 — Trainees generally do well with this behavior

If the teacher does not state a specific lesson objective, but:

- States a broad lesson objective, OR
- The lesson objective can be inferred from the lesson activities this behavior is scored Medium.

Tip: Ask trainees: Can the lesson objective be inferred from the lesson activities?

22 Comparative percentages data was taken from the combined reliability scores from the Punjab, DC, and UVA trainings.

# TEACH TRAINING DAY 2-5

# Lesson objectives, activities, and topics

Remind trainees the difference between lesson objectives, activities, and topics. This is an important distinction for this behavior. For example, if a teacher says, “Now we will read Uncle Tom’s Cabin together,” this is an activity not an objective. If a teacher says, “Today our topic is nouns,” this is a topic rather than a specific learning goal. Topics are often considered broad lesson objectives.

# Switching topics

Teachers may switch topics during a lesson and not state lesson objectives or learning goals. If trainees are able to follow along and the routines seem established (e.g. the students don’t seem confused), then this behavior may be scored a Medium, provided the same conditions are met.

# 3.2 — Trainees generally do well with this behavior

Both clear and unclear. If the teacher provides a mix of clear and unclear answers and explanations, this behavior is scored Medium. As long as the teacher provides some explanations, even if they are confusing/unclear, this will not be a Low and will be scored Medium.

# Accuracy vs. clarity

This behavior is assessing clarity of the teacher’s instructions and not the accuracy of content; therefore, this behavior could be scored a High even if a teacher’s explanation is inaccurate, provided the students seem to understand and the explanation is clear.

Tip: Don’t worry about the accuracy of the teacher’s statements, just think about how clear they are. Look at the students to see if they seem confused or if they are following along.

# 3.3 — Trainees generally do well with this behavior

This behavior is scored Low if the teacher does not make a connection to other content or students’ daily lives. If there is any connection made, even if it is superficial, it is scored Medium.

Remember — any superficial connection to prior content knowledge also makes it a Medium. This behavior is scored Medium if the teacher attempts to connect the lesson to other content knowledge or students’ lives, but this is ineffective.

Note: Ineffective connections are confusing, unclear, or superficial. For example, if a teacher says, “Your family includes your father and your mother, what is it?” while teaching a lesson about collective nouns, this is scored a Medium. The example is relatable to students but largely brief and superficial.

The behavior is a High only if the teacher intentionally and meaningfully links the lesson to other content knowledge or the students’ daily lives.

Note: The teacher does not need to both connect the lesson to content knowledge and students’ daily lives. A meaningful connection to at least one of these is scored High.

3.4 — Trainees are more likely to correctly score this behavior as a Low, but when the score is a Medium only 40% score correctly; 16% incorrectly score it Low and 44% incorrectly score it High. Also, when the score is a High only 34% score correctly; 36% incorrectly score it Low and 30% incorrectly score it Medium.

An action is considered modeling so long as the teacher demonstrates/enacts procedures and/or thinking processes related to the learning activity. If the teacher does this partially, it’s a Medium, if the teacher does this fully, it is a High.

Tip — on how to notice modeling — Is there a procedure or thinking process being taught? If so, is the teacher showing/explaining it to the students?

For example — displaying an answer on the board without an explanation of the process of thinking behind it does not “count” toward modeling a final product. This is not considered modeling procedures nor thinking aloud.

To be scored a High, the teacher must completely model the learning activity by enacting all parts of the procedure or by enacting the procedure AND thinking aloud. If the teacher enacts the procedure (e.g. giving a model sentence) but does not think aloud (or vice versa) this is a Medium. If the teacher does neither of these, it is a Low.

Tip — Remind trainees that this behavioral marker refers to the teacher modeling the learning activity, or the teacher working with the students to co-construct a model.

# Guiding Questions

What constitutes a lesson objective or learning goal?

Can an objective be inferred from the classroom activities?

# 3.1

If the teacher states an objective, is it a broad topic or a specific learning objective?

Does the stated objective answer the question of why the students are learning a specific topic?

# 3.2

Is there any explanation of content? If so, is it clear? Are there mixed clear and unclear explanations?

# 3.3

Does the teacher make explicit connections between the lesson and students’ daily lives or other content knowledge?

If the teacher does make an explicit connection, is it explicitly connected to the lesson objective?

# 3.4

Is there a learning activity? Did the teacher show the students what this process or skill looks like?

Are the students given the opportunity to practice their new skill during the segment or in the near future?

Is there any part of the process that the students need to know how to do that the teacher did not show or explain?

Showing trainees how behaviors play out in a real classroom can be very helpful to influence their thinking. Consider giving the following examples to help guide trainees thinking.

| 3.1 Mozambique   | The teacher does not state a lesson objective, nor can one be inferred from the lesson activities. Although the students are clearly drawing something, the goal of the learning activity cannot be inferred. The teacher states objectives for the homework, but it is not about the current lesson.                                                                                                                                                      | The teacher does not explicitly state the lesson objective, but one can be inferred from the activities. The teacher reviews the alphabet before teaching the students about syllables and word formation. Once they complete the alphabet activity, the teacher asks the students to come up with syllables and then words on their own. All of the activities align with the inferred lesson objective. | The teacher explicitly states the lesson objective towards the end of the segment: “Today we are going to learn syllable formation.” Additionally, the activity about reading the alphabet is related to the lesson objective since they need to know the alphabet to form syllables.        |
| Punjab           | The teacher does not state the lesson objectives. The teacher begins the class by reading from a book and continues without making any connection of the objectives of the lesson and the activities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | The teacher states, “Today our topic is nouns,” which is a broad topic rather than a specific learning goal. However, the learning activities are related to nouns, so this is scored Medium.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | The teacher clearly states the lesson objective by saying "Our topic today is to compare the numbers and write the correct signs," and "We are going to learn how to compare numbers when you have more than two numbers." Moreover, the different activities are related to this objective. |
| 3.2 Philippines  | There is not a lot of explanation of content, and the explanations of content the teacher do give are unclear. The activity begins with subtraction and then transitions to division without any explanation. After going through the answers twice, she summarizes, "To achieve, we repeatedly reverse it to get to the division statement," which further confuses the students. She also writes "6/2" on the board but then demonstrates 9/3 in groups. | The teacher's explanations of the content are somewhat clear but some explanations are confusing. For example, when introducing the categorizing activity, the teacher says, "I have three groups here" and has the students read, "Person, Place, Thing" but does not provide further explanation.                                                                                                       | The teacher’s explanation of the content is clear and easy to understand. The teacher explains the meaning of every new word by using multiple and varied examples. The teacher also provides pictures that accompany each word as a visual representation to help them understand.          |

# COMMON AREAS OF CONFUSION: LESSON FACILITATION

# Mozambique

There is no explanation of con- tent. The students continuously read letters and syllables out loud, and the teacher does not explain any content to the students.

The teacher does provide some explanations of content and gives different examples to illustrate what a proper noun is. For example, the teacher says, "Proper nouns are an element that's written with an uppercase letter first." The teacher also gives many different examples to illustrate the content. For example, using a student’s name, showing it with a capital letter and a lowercase, to demonstrate the difference. The teacher also does this using the name of the place where a student was born. The teacher helps students better understand by saying that countries, capitols, and names are proper nouns. She then proceeds to use different activities to help students understand.

# 3.3 Mozambique

The teacher does not explicitly connect what is being taught to other content knowledge or the students’ daily lives. The teacher shows students how to arrive at a total number of fruit using addition or multiplication but does not refer to addition as something they learned previously, nor does the teacher connect to how students might use the processes in their daily lives. Similarly, the teacher uses fruit in some examples and asks students if they like bananas and apples but does not make an explicit connection between the students liking a specific fruit and multiplication.

# TEACH TRAINING MANUAL

# TEACH TRAINING DAY 2-5

# Philippines

The teacher does not connect the content to the students’ daily lives or other content knowledge. The teacher uses shapes to show fractions, which is not a connection as it does not specifically connect to the daily lives of students. Additionally, the teacher does not draw the connection for the students between the prior content knowledge and what they are doing now.

For example, when the student selects the picture of Coco Martin, the teacher asks, "Do you know who this is?" The student replies, "Yes, Coco Martin!" The teacher then says, "So there are a few adjectives we can give Cardo" (referring to the role he plays in a television program). While this does connect the lesson content to students' daily lives, the instance is isolated and brief.

Another example includes explaining the word "church." The teacher says, "Have you been to a church? What do you do in the church? Who do you go to church with?"

Another example includes explaining the word "door." The teacher says, "Your houses have doors, why? What do we do with a door? Is there a door in this classroom? How many doors are in your classroom? We pass through doors. During the night we close the house door." For the word "rain" she says, "Is there rain today? When it rains, do we get wet? When it rains what do we use? Raincoat or umbrella?"

# 3.4 Mozambique

There is no evidence of teacher modeling, thinking aloud or enacting any learning activity. Although the teacher asks them to write ordinal numbers on the board, she does not show the students how to do so.

There is partial modeling in this segment when the teacher demonstrates on the board the difference in proper nouns when she writes down Flavio's name with a capital "F" and with a lowercase "f" to show that proper nouns start with capital letters. As this is not the only thing that makes a noun a proper noun (for example, the first letter of a sentence starts with a capital but is not necessarily a proper noun) this is considered a partial model.

The teacher completely models the learning activity by enacting all parts of the procedure and thinking aloud. In one occasion, the teacher explains to a student what to do, "One syllable, two syllables, three syllables, four syllables, the fifth syllable is missing." With the letter "C" the teacher says, "We said we form syllables from these letters here, the vowels. We use the consonant first. The result is ba, be, bi, bo, bu, right? Now we're on letter C. This one gave us, ca, ce, ci, co. So, which one is missing?" The other instance of modeling happens when the students are doing individual...

work and the teacher realizes that one student did not understand: "We first formed syllables with letter B. Over here. With letter B. We used B with A, B with E, B with I, B with O, B with U! We did the same with letter C and with letter D. Now it's letter F."

| Punjab | The teacher does not model by enacting or thinking aloud during the course of the lesson. | The teacher partially models the learning activity by taking the students through the part of the process of looking at a photo and identifying a good verb to choose to describe the picture. The teacher only provides one verb as an example, but the learning activity requires the students to identify three verbs for each image. Therefore, the teacher does not completely model the process. | The teacher fully models the learning activity through a process of co-construction with the students. Particularly, she shows the different steps of the procedure and asks students different questions to help them better understand the process. For example, the teacher says, "Now what will be the next step?", "Have we reached our answer?", and "What will we do with this one?" In addition, the teacher shows more than one way of doing the procedure and says, "Is this process easier or the one that we did before this?" |

# Lesson Facilitation: FAQs

(3.1) The students are just reading and discussing a story for class, the teacher says, “Today we’re going to talk about [title of story].” Would this count as stating the lesson objective? Although the teacher clearly defines the activity for class, there is still probably some objective behind why they are reading the story (vocabulary, part of speech, etc.). This statement alone would not count as an explicit definition of the lesson objective and would need other evidence of a clear or broad lesson objective to score a Medium or High.

(3.2a) How do I code this behavior if the focus of the class is an activity? Content includes directions for activities. If the teacher’s directions for activities are confusing, the score would be marked low. If the teacher’s directions are somewhat clear, this would be marked medium. If the directions are clear, this would be marked High.

TEACH TRAINING MANUAL 35

# TEACH TRAINING DAY 2-5

# (3.2b) The teacher explains the content

Yes, if the teacher's explanation of content is clear and easy to understand, this would still be scored a High. This element does not assess the accuracy of content, but rather, how the content is delivered. Thus, if the teacher's explanations are wrong but consistently clear, it would still be scored a High. This element does not require the observer to discern correct from incorrect material.

# (3.3a) What exactly counts as students’ daily lives and how is it determined to be “meaningful?”

The teacher needs to explicitly state how the content is related to the students’ lives, rather than the observers inferring what they think is related to the students’ lives. If the teacher only mentions objects students may encounter in their daily lives, such as “lets count the flowers,” this is not considered a meaningful connection. However, if the teacher makes an explicit statement that connects to student’s lives, such as, “here is a flower like the one that we have in the garden,” that would be an attempt to make a connection. In the above example, barring other evidence the behavior would be scored as a medium because it is not explicitly connected to the lesson objective. However, if after making the explicit connection to their own garden s/he connects the example to the lesson objective by saying “so if we have two gardens with six flowers each, how many flowers are there total?” This would constitute a High score because the teacher explicitly related the example to both students’ daily lives and the lesson objective.

# (3.3b) What counts as making connections to other content knowledge? Does recalling what was learned in a previous lesson count as a connection?

It may — particularly if the teacher attempts to explicitly connect the lesson to the past content knowledge. For example, if the teacher says, "Remember when we learned the alphabet? Today we will use the alphabet to form syllables.” This would be scored medium because although the teacher explicitly connects new content to past content, s/he only does so superficially. However, if the teacher further explained how to use the alphabet to form syllables, this would be scored High because the teacher is not only recalling what was learned in a past lesson and referencing how it connects to new content but builds upon past content to contextualize new material. If the teacher simply recalled what was learned in a previous lesson, without making an explicit connection to the current lesson, this would be scored a low — for example, the teacher may say, “Remember how we learned about fractions yesterday? Today we’re going to learn about decimal places.”

# (3.4a) I’m having trouble with modeling; how do I know when I see it? What should we specifically look for in modeling?

Modeling a procedure or skill will mirror an activity that students are asked to do in that lesson or in the near future. Teachers can model by enacting the procedure (showing how to perform a task) or thinking aloud. Cognitive modeling, or a “think aloud,” refers to when a teacher explicitly discusses a thought process or strategy to students by thinking through the challenge aloud (e.g., how to extract important information from a word problem, how to determine theme in a text). When the teacher enacts a procedure, s/he shows all, or some, of the steps in a process for a complete or partial model. Showing the end product could look different across disciplines; however, it essentially gives the students an example for which to strive.

# COMMON AREAS OF CONFUSION: LESSON FACILITATION

# (3.4b) Does the modeling always have to happen before the activity?

Although the traditional idea of modeling is when the teacher enacts or thinks aloud a task, and then the students complete the same activity, modeling doesn’t always have to take place before the activity. Modeling can occur whenever the teacher enacts a procedure or thinks aloud regardless of whether it is at the beginning or end of the activity. For this to occur, it’s important that the enacted task or presented think aloud is the same as the task the students are expected to perform or have performed. Modeling can occur at the end of class if the teacher walks students through the thinking process as s/he solves a problem. However, simply revealing the answer to a learning activity or a math problem is not considered modeling.

# (3.4c) What is the difference between an instructional explanation and modeling?

To model for students, the teacher needs to perform the task or parts of the task s/he is asking the students to do. This is different than giving them directions or explaining an activity as it involves the teacher demonstrating it. The teacher may also demonstrate her/his thinking process as part of the modeling. If the task is to learn the meaning of new words in a text and the teacher simply provides students with a definition of a word, while this may contribute to a clear explanation (3.2) it does not necessarily constitute modeling. An example of modeling is if the teacher were to demonstrate how she uses context clues to find the meaning of a word. For example, the teacher may say, “when I don’t know the meaning of a word (in this case abrupt), I reread the sentence, and think about the context, here I read……., therefore I know this means something like sudden or unexpected.” In a math classroom, the teacher may be working with students to estimate lengths in standard units. S/he may explain the length of a centimeter and provide examples of common objects that are a centimeter long—this is part of her instructional explanation (3.2). To model, the teacher may show students how to estimate. For example, s/he may show the width of his/her finger is approximately 1 cm and that s/he can use this knowledge to try to estimate the length of a pencil by thinking about (or measuring) how many of her finger widths fit along the length of the pencil.

# (3.4d) I’m still having trouble identifying modeling, any other tips?

To determine whether the teacher has modeled:

1. Ask yourself: What is the learning activity? What are students being asked to do or learn? Did the teacher show the students what this process or skill looks like?
2. Ask yourself: Is the thing students are being asked to do a process or a thinking skill?
1. If students are asked to do a thinking skill, the teacher would have to do a think aloud to be scored at the “High” level. If the task is procedural, the teacher should show students all steps in the process.
2. The students then complete a similar activity in that lesson or in the near future.

# TEACH TRAINING DAY 2-5

(3.4e) If the teacher models a procedure — for division, for example — but then the students are requested to do a different division activity, is it considered modeling?

(3.4f) Can students and teachers co-construct a model or should it be entirely teacher-led?

If the students did some of the procedure, it could be partial modeling. But if what the students are doing is unrelated with the procedure shown by the teacher, it would not count as modeling. So, while the activity does not need to be identical, some or all of the procedures that were modeled would need to be included in the activity to be counted as evidence towards modeling.

Yes. Although we often think of teachers presenting a model for the benefit of the student, there are some cases where modeling is not completely led by the teacher and the students may be a part of the process. For example, the students and the teacher co-construct knowledge by enacting a procedure together.

# COMMON AREAS OF CONFUSION: CHECKS FOR UNDERSTANDING

# Checks for Understanding

# Terms

While many of the terms used in the Teach Manual might be clear to some trainees, others may need additional explanation to clarify uncertainty:

“Systematically Monitors” — This refers to the teacher’s behavior during student group/in-dependent work. When a teacher “systematically monitors” a classroom, s/he walks around the classroom observing most or all student work, clarifying concepts, and asking questions. If the teacher observes only some students work or none at all, this is not systematically monitoring.

# Explanation

Based on evidence from prior trainings, trainees reliably scored Checks for Understanding 82% of the time. Coders were less reliable on the following behaviors: 4.1 (Medium), 4.2 (Low) and 4.3 (Medium). The behaviors trainees found most difficult are outlined below.²³

# Troublesome Points

4.1 — Trainees are more likely to correctly score this behavior when it is a Low or a High, but when the score is a Medium only 26% score correctly; 42% incorrectly score it Low and 32% incorrectly score it High.

Remind trainees that the teacher needs to ask questions to check for understanding. However, these questions can be verbal or written (i.e. a small quiz).

# See table below to help with scoring:

|                              | Ineffective | Effective |
| ---------------------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| Few Students (less than 50%) | Medium      | Low       |
| Most Students (50% or more)  | High        | Low       |

This behavior is scored Medium when the teacher asks questions or prompts fewer than 50% of students effectively throughout the lesson, which can occur when fewer than 50% of students raise their hands to respond to a question or the teacher only calls on some students (i.e. students at the front of the classroom or those willing to volunteer).

The teacher is ineffective at determining the students’ level of understanding as a result of the quality of question. For example, if the teacher says, “Do you understand?” and students respond, “Yes” in synchrony, this is ineffective. This question does not provide the teacher with information about the students’ level of understanding. It could also be the case that the

Comparative percentages data was taken from the combined reliability scores from the Punjab, DC, and UVA trainings. It is fully recognized that data may be biased as trainees may change their scores to help them pass the certification exam (i.e., coding a 2 when they think should score a 1 to give themselves a “buffer” as reliable is defined as scoring within 1 value of the master code). Note that the manual has changed for 4.3 since the trainings.

TEACH TRAINING MANUAL 39

# TEACH TRAINING DAY 2-5

Teacher asks a question but it is not checking understanding. For example, “what do you have to eat yesterday?”

Tip — Have trainees count how many students go up to the board and the number of hands that respond to the teacher’s questions that check for understanding. If the majority of students go up to the board and/or respond individually to questions, this teacher is effective at determining the level of student understanding.

# 4.2

Trainees are more likely to correctly score this behavior when it is a Medium or a High, but when the score is a Low only 34% score correctly; 38% incorrectly score it N/A, 16% incorrectly score Medium, and 12% incorrectly score it High.

Distinguish between a Low and N/A

Remind trainees to distinguish between a Low and N/A; if there is no observable group or independent work, this behavior is scored as non-applicable (N/A). If there is observable group or independent work and the teacher does not monitor students, then this behavior is scored Low. For example, if the teacher has her back to the class while they copy equations from the board, or sits at her desk grading homework, or leaves the classroom, etc. while the students are working this behavior is scored Low.

# Medium score

To be scored a Medium, the teacher must see some students’ work during independent/group work. For example, if the teacher walks around 1/3 of the classroom glancing at students’ notebooks as they are working, this behavior is scored Medium.

# High score

To be scored High, the teacher must circulate most of the classroom and approach students to observe their work, clarify concepts, and ask questions.

Note — if the teacher circulates most of the students but there aren’t any signs of checking/interaction then this would be scored a Medium.

Tip — Watch the teacher for visual cues that they are looking at student work and clarifying concepts, etc.

# 4.3

Trainees are more likely to correctly score this behavior when it is a Low or a Medium, but when the score is a High only 36% score correctly; 52% incorrectly score it Medium and 12% incorrectly score it Low.

If the teacher substantially adjusts teaching for students, this behavior is scored High. The teacher may adjust teaching through back and forth exchanges with students to help them understand or by providing more challenging tasks, for this to be scored High.

Remember — If the teacher does not adjust, even if the teacher is checking for student understanding and/or the students seem to be following along, this behavior is scored Low.

Remind trainees that adjusting does not have to be an explicit statement such as, “Let’s review this again.” Furthermore, adjusting teaching means giving students more opportunities to learn, so the teacher may also do this in many ways. For example, the teacher may give.
---
# COMMON AREAS OF CONFUSION: CHECKS FOR UNDERSTANDING

more time to finish a task, take time to review concepts, or provide feedback (see Note be- low). These are all examples of adjusting, which differentiates a Low from a Medium and High.

Note — There can be overlap between feedback and adjusting teaching since the teacher can comment on the students’ work and adjust the lesson; however, not all feedback is considered adjusting. For example, if the teacher tells a student, “You should reword that sentence,” this is considered feedback but not adjusting as it does not reiterate concepts for students who are struggling or provide more challenging tasks for those who are ahead.

# Guiding Questions

Does the teacher gain information on most students’ level of understanding?

# 4.1

| 4.1 Punjab       | The teacher asks the students some questions but is ineffective at determining their level of understanding. Particularly, the teacher keeps asking them the definition of certain words by saying "What does that mean?" but provides an answer almost immediately. Because the teacher does not listen for students’ answers, this is not considered a question to determine the students’ level of understanding. | The teacher asks several questions to determine students' level of understanding but is only somewhat effective meeting that goal. For example, the teacher calls on a student to explain what a noun is and to give examples by saying, "Stand up and tell me what is noun," "Name any five things," and "Tell me the name of any city." However, the teacher only calls on a few students.                                                                                                                | In addition to asking individual students questions and asking questions to which each student gives a response, the teacher also checks all of the students' work individually. For example, the teacher asks, "Have you understood what is a noun?" and gives the students an activity where each student has to name three nouns. This helps the teacher determine each student's level of understanding. |
| Mozambique       | The teacher does not ask students questions or provide any checks to identify their level of understanding, the teacher looks at the students’ homework from the previous lesson.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | The teacher does ask some questions that are somewhat effective at determining student understanding but does not do so for the majority of students. For example, the teacher asks, "What do we mean with that?" and "Are you following?", but the students answer in synchrony. However, the teacher effectively questions a few students who are asked to go to the board, for example, by saying, "Now, we have a proper noun in this sentence...So you come and draw a circle around the proper noun." | Although this is a good check for understanding, the teacher only was able to obtain information on the level of understanding of a few students. In addition, the teacher asks all the students to put numbers in ascending and descending order at their seats and then checks their work as they finish.                                                                                                  |

# 4.2 Philippines

The teacher does not monitor students when they are working independently with their whiteboards. During the activity, the teacher did briefly walk around and look at students to see if they had completed the problem; however, the students had already finished, so this does not count toward monitoring during group work.

The teacher monitors some students when they are working to verify their understanding. The teacher does not systematically circulate the entire classroom but does look at student work, particularly the two students’ work on the left side of the class.

The teacher systematically monitors most students while they are working in three groups. The teacher visits each group and appears to be observing most students' work, making comments, and asking questions. For example, the teacher tells group three to count the fish and asks group one, "What is a box?" The teacher was not monitoring the students who had completed their task at the end of the segment but was still monitoring the students who were working. The teacher is not penalized for failing to monitor the remainder of the students for that portion of the segment because they are not engaged in an activity and are simply waiting for their classmates.

#  Mozambique

The teacher does not monitor the students when they are working independently, copying what's on the board. The teacher sits at the desk in the front of the classroom and waits for them to finish. At the beginning of the segment, the teacher checks a few students' homework, but this does not count as monitoring during independent work as this is work the students had previously completed.

The teacher monitors some students during independent work by going to students' seats and making sure that they are working. For example, the teacher asks two students what they are talking about when they are distracted, asks another student if they have finished their work, and says to another student: "I asked you not to leave blank pages. If you do it, you ruin it." However, the teacher does not walk around the entire classroom to check on the rest of the students in this segment.

Particularly, the teacher gives comments about their work and repeats instructions. For example, the teacher says, "Are you done?", "I said it was only 3 syllables." "The other ones are done differently," "Write it down so I can see," "Is this done?", and "You are behind. We’re not using these letters."

TEACH TRAINING MANUAL 43

# TEACH TRAINING DAY 2-5

# 4.3 Punjab

The teacher asks, “Are you all done?” but this statement is just to check whether the students are writing the answers instead of to check for student understanding for adjustment purposes. Apart from that we don't see any adjustment in teaching by the teacher.

# Philippines

The teacher does not adjust teaching for students who didn't understand. During the whiteboard activity, the teacher mostly ignores the students who have the incorrect answer. The teacher briefly reviews the answers with the students: "4 minus 2 is 2," but this does not provide additional learning opportunities or clarify misconceptions. Additionally, students who already have a more advanced understanding and finish their work quickly are not provided with any additional learning opportunities.

When the teacher is talking with the rectangle group, which incorrectly folds the paper twice (into fourths) instead of into halves, she asks, "Look, is this half?" and "How many times was it divided?" The teacher briefly spent time to further explain the concept of dividing in half but did not substantially adjust teaching. When one student is called upon to read a word, she struggles with the pronunciation. The teacher works with the student and helps her until she correctly pronounces the word. Again, when another student incorrectly categorizes a name as a thing (in the lesson about nouns), the teacher takes time to address the issue, and makes sure the students understand. This is made apparent when the teacher says, "If I were Mrs. Maria am I a thing?"

# COMMON AREAS OF CONFUSION: CHECKS FOR UNDERSTANDING

# Checks for Understanding: FAQs

# (4.1a) Can an activity be a way to check for understanding?

It is important to stick to the manual by remembering that the teacher needs to ask questions to check for understanding. However, the questions asked by the teacher can be written or verbal, which would be inclusive of an activity. For instance, the teacher may pass out a written quiz to students and check their answers to determine their level of understanding. It is important to note that just giving a quiz is not a check for understanding; the teacher must check the students’ answers during the segment for it to count as a check for understanding. Additionally, checking homework (or work that was assigned prior to the observed segment) is not counted towards checking for understanding, unless it is clear that the content of the work is related to the current lesson.

# (4.1b) How do I know what constitutes an “effective” check for understanding?

This behavior is designed to capture the extent to which the teacher makes an effort to check if students understand the content. In an effective check for understanding, the teacher gives individual students the opportunity to show what they know. For example, a highly-effective check way to check for understanding, is by having students come to the board to complete a math problem. This is classified as such because the teacher is able to see the extent to which each individual student understands and is able to complete the task; however, this system does not allow for the teacher to gain information about MOST students’ understanding. What differentiates between a medium and a high score is whether the teacher gains information on MOST students’ understanding over the course of the lesson. For example, a highly effective way a teacher could determine most students’ understanding is by asking them to agree or disagree with statements by showing a thumbs up or down. This behavior does not capture if the teacher does something with that information (this is captured in behavior 5.3).

# (4.2a) During independent/group work the teacher walks around but does not approach or talk to students at all. Does this count as monitoring?

Yes. The teacher can verify students' understanding without providing comments; at times it is difficult to tell whether the teacher is looking at student work as s/he walks around the classroom. Thus, if the teacher simply walks around the classroom during independent or group work, this would be scored a medium. Visual cues should also be considered: e.g., the teacher pointing to the students' work, leaning in, saying something the observer may not be able to hear. If the teacher is observed monitoring most students in this way, it may be scored a high.

# (4.2b) The teacher asks students to write the school name and date in their notebooks. They spend a significant amount of time doing this. Does this count as independent work?

Yes, writing in their notebooks is a learning task for students who do it independently. Other examples of independent work are: copying down examples from the board when the teacher asks them to and independently completing tasks given by the teacher (e.g., write down a proper noun, draw a picture, complete math equations, etc.).

TEACH TRAINING MANUAL 45

# TEACH TRAINING DAY 2-5

If students are reading something in unison (e.g., the alphabet) and the teacher circulates the classroom and approaches individual students and corrects them, this would count as a whole-group activity. Thus, it does not count as independent/group work. The teacher's comments would be captured under feedback (6.1) and/or adjusting (4.3).

# (4.3a) The teacher does not adjust teaching, but s/he is checking for student understanding

As this element is designed to capture the teacher adjusting for student understanding it would still be scored a low if the teacher doesn’t adjust, even if there is no perceived need.

How would I score this situation?

# (4.3b) Most of the adjustment examples are about explanation of content, are there other ways a teacher could adjust?

Although the teacher may effectively adjust by further explaining content, as adjusting teaching means giving more opportunities to learn, the teacher may also do this in other ways. For example, the teacher may give more time to finish a task, provide students who finish before with additional or more advanced tasks or provide feedback. Sometimes there may be an overlap between feedback and adjusting teaching since the teacher can comment on the students’ work and adjust the lesson; however, not all feedback should be counted as adjusting.

# COMMON AREAS OF CONFUSION: FEEDBACK

# Feedback

Terms While many of the terms used in the Teach Manual might be clear to some trainees, others may need additional explanation to clarify uncertainty:

“Prompts” — pieces of information (i.e. guiding hints or questions) given by the teacher that encourage students to think through misunderstandings or identify successes.

# Explanation

Based on evidence from prior trainings, trainees reliably scored Feedback 79% of the time. Coders were less reliable when the master code was 2, 3, or 4. The behaviors trainees found most difficult are outlined below.24

| Low    | Ineffective        | The teacher either does not provide feedback about student misunderstandings or this feedback is simple, evaluative (i.e. incorrect statements).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Medium | Somewhat Effective | This feedback is general or superficial. For example, the teacher may tell the students that they forgot periods at the end of their sentences. Alternatively, teachers may provide superficial hints or ask questions to guide students to the correct thinking or procedure such as asking students to remember what they need in order to write a sentence. These comments do not explain why a period is important or provide specific information to help the students understand where they went wrong in writing sentences. |
| High   | Highly Effective   | The teacher provides specific feedback with regard to student misunderstandings. The teacher should clarify what individual students do not understand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

24 Comparative percentages data was taken from the combined reliability scores from the Punjab, DC, and UVA trainings. It is fully recognized that data may be biased as trainees may change their scores to help them pass the certification exam (i.e. coding a 2 when they think should score a 1 to give themselves a “buffer” as reliable is defined as scoring within 1 value of the master code). Note that the manual has changed for this element since the trainings. Behavior 5.2 was added after the trainings.

# TEACH TRAINING DAY 2-5

# 5.2 — There is no data for this behavior

This behavior follows similar guidelines to the behavior above. However, this behavior focuses on identifying student successes, not clarifying misunderstandings. For example, a low score for this behavior would be, “The teacher either does not provide feedback about student successes or this feedback is simple, evaluative (i.e. correct statements).

Note - Trainees may confuse feedback that identifies successes (Behavior 6.2) with positive language (Behavior 1.2). However, this behavior focuses on comments/prompts with substantive information that helps identify student successes. These comments/prompts should be specific, substantive, and reference students’ work. In addition, this feedback does not necessarily need to include positive language. In contrast, positive language may refer to student behavior, student work, etc.

# Guiding Questions

- Does the teacher give the students prompts?
- Does the teacher give the students comments?
- 5.1 Do the teacher’s comments and prompts help students better understand what they did wrong?
- Does the teacher’s feedback specifically refer to the learning activity?
- Does the teacher provide students with comments/prompts about their misunderstandings in the learning activity?
- Do the teacher’s comments help students better understand what was good about something they did right?
- 5.2 Does the teacher say “Correct” about student work or responses?
- How specific are the teacher’s comments?

# Punjab

The teacher's limited feedback to students in this segment is comprised of simple, evaluative statements such as, “Incorrect.” The teacher prompts students about their work, but these are superficial. For example, the teacher asks: "Is three, six, or twelve?" when a student responds incorrectly. Also, when a student is working on the board, the teacher says, "What sign will come here?" and "What will we do here?"

After looking at the definitions on the board, what do you think this child is doing in this picture?” This feedback is specific and helps clarify a student’s misunderstanding.

# Vietnam

The teacher gives some brief feedback on the students’ work. “You have to look at him/her,” “Read more slowly please,” “Please read again so you can fully memorize it,” and “Palm forest, not grass forest.” While she provides comments, they are superficial and do not help the students understand how to improve.

# 5.2 Philippines

The teacher does not give any specific prompts or comments to help clarify student's misunderstanding.

# COMMON AREAS OF CONFUSION: FEEDBACK

# Afghanistan

The teacher provides students with some comments about their work but most of them are very general or superficial. For example, she says "Well done", "Good" and "Bravo" without giving more specific feedback. However, there are a few times when the teacher provides more comments, such as "Well done, you have studied both new and last lessons!" and "Did you see how well he told us the concept of the lesson?"

# Vietnam

Throughout the video, the teacher provides students with specific comments regarding the students’ spelling and grammar. At the end of the video, the teacher provides feedback to the entire class about what they have done well: "So through this activity I can see that you know how to use word and expression to write sentences using personifying images. I can see that you have been doing very well" also, "you have known how to use personifying technique... from animals and things around, you can write sentences." Although her feedback may be relatively brief moments, they are specific and provide substantive information.

# Mozambique

The teacher provides simple, evaluative statements as feedback in this segment. The teacher responds, "Yes. Correct," when a group of students display their work. The teacher provides some comments about students’ successes. Specifically, the teacher provides one superficial comment: "He said something very important. Now it sounded great. He is right." This comment does not contain substantive information.

# COMMON AREAS OF CONFUSION: FEEDBACK

# Feedback: FAQs

(5.1/5.2) There is only one instance where the teacher provides specific comments. Is this enough for scoring a high?

Yes, but it depends on the quality of the teacher feedback. If the teacher gives one comment and provides substantive information about what a student did well on or helps clarify misunderstandings, this could be scored as a high. For example, while giving feedback to a student, the teacher may say, “With what number should ascending order start? Biggest or smallest? The smallest. But you started with the biggest. Ascending order starts with smallest, so it has to be like this.” However, if the comment is somewhat vague or in the form of a hint then this would likely be considered a medium. For example, while students are completing independent work the teacher may circulate and tell a student, "Don't write it there, start writing it from here" or "Leave room for your words to breathe.” These comments are not specific.

# Critical Thinking

# Terms

As trainees completed a worksheet with terms, there no terms that need to be clarified.

# Explanation

Based on evidence from prior trainings, trainees reliably scored Critical Thinking 87% of the time. Coders were less reliable on behaviors 6.1 (Medium). The behaviors trainees found most difficult are outlined below.25

# Troublesome Points

# 6.1

Trainees are more likely to correctly score this behavior as a Low or a High, but when the score is a Medium only 39% score correctly; 41% incorrectly score it Low and 19% incorrectly score it High.

Remind trainees that if the teacher asks two or more open ended questions it is scored at least a Medium. The questions don’t have to be of high complexity or quality to be a Medium. To be scored High, the teacher must build upon student responses. The teacher can do this by asking a student to justify their reasoning or further explain and/or clarify their ideas. This is called a follow up question.

Tip — Tell trainees to count the number of open-ended questions the teacher asks the students and note if any are follow up or not. If the teacher asks:

- open-ended questions, this is scored Low
- open-ended questions (1 may be a follow up) or 3+ open-ended questions with no follow up question, this is scored Medium
- 3+ open-ended questions with at least one follow-up question this is scored High

# 6.2

Trainees generally do well with this behavior. To be scored Medium, the teacher provides superficial thinking tasks, for example matching vocabulary words and their parts of speech into groups, but this task is similar to one the teacher has already demonstrated.

Other qualities of a thinking task may include analyzing concepts, discovering meaning, drawing conclusions, interpreting information, generalizing, formulating explanations (or arguments), identifying patterns, considering other perspectives, making connections, and classifying information. See Thinking Task table on opposite page for examples.

Note — this behavior refers only to the teacher providing a thinking task and is not dependent on the students’ responses.

25Comparative percentages data was taken from the combined reliability scores from the Punjab, DC, and UVA trainings. It is fully recognized that data may be biased as trainees may change their scores to help them pass the certification exam (i.e., coding a 2 when they think should score a 1 to give themselves a “buffer” as reliable is defined as scoring within 1 value of the master code). Note that the manual has changed for 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 since the trainings.

# 6.3 — Trainees generally do well with this behavior

A student may perform a thinking task but not ask an open-ended. When this is the case, this behavior is scored Medium.

Note — This behavior refers only to the students asking an open-ended question or performing a thinking task.

It is possible students may complete a thinking task by answering a thinking question (see FAQ).

Refer to the thinking task table in the manual for more explanation.

# Guiding Questions

- Does the teacher ask open-ended questions? How many?
- # 6.1

Does the teacher build on student responses to open-ended questions?
- Does the teacher provide a thinking task?
- # 6.2

Does the thinking task require students to make predictions, identify patterns, explain thinking, make connections, or interpret information?
- Does the thinking task include applying learned information or techniques to new tasks?
- Do the students ask open-ended questions?
- # 6.3

Do the students complete activities that require comparison, analysis, explanation, or interpretation?

Why do you respect your family?” These examples have more than one answer and require student explanations. |

clothes, the teacher says, "Did you figure it out how he did it?", then "What is the first category?", and "Can we find another way instead of drawing pictures?" The teacher and students co-construct the solution of how to determine the number of categories through dialogue.

# 6.2 Philippines

In this segment, the students are being asked to name the shapes from a song, to identify shapes from cards, and to shade in fractions. These tasks do not have processes required for a thinking task.

The students have a thinking task to complete when they are asked to apply their knowledge of fractions by folding the shape papers into halves and quarters. The task seems superficial as one student folds the oval into fourths when they are supposed to be creating halves, and the teacher responds to the incorrect folding by saying, “No, I showed you fourths. Fold it in half.” The students are clearly doing some work to apply what they know about shapes, division, and fractions. This is still a fairly superficial task however, and thus this behavioral marker is scored Medium.

# Mozambique

There is no evidence the teacher provides a thinking task in this segment. The exercise provided is copying a text from the board and reciting the alphabet, both of which are rote activities that do not qualify as thinking tasks.

The teacher does provide a superficial thinking task when she asks students to think on their own of a proper noun. This requires students to make connections with other information they know. In one other part of a lesson, some students are asked to come up to the board and circle the proper noun in the sentence, which again is a superficial thinking task which only moderately makes students analyze a sentence and identify the correct word.

# Critical Thinking: FAQs

# (6.1)

The teacher asks many open-ended questions but does not give the students a chance to respond or answers on behalf of the students. How should I score this?

This is a good example of what may distinguish a high from a medium. If a teacher asks many open-ended questions but does not give students a chance to respond or answers on behalf of the students, then the teacher cannot build upon student responses. Thus, this would be scored a medium. To score a high, the teacher must ask three or more open-ended questions AND at least one of these questions should build upon student responses.

# (6.2/6.3)

How do I score this behavior if the students are completing a worksheet? How do I know if the worksheet includes a thinking task or not?

If it’s impossible to determine what is on the worksheet, this would not count towards a thinking task. Remember, you can only score what you see or hear. If you receive some indication of what is on the worksheet (e.g. through the teacher's instructions, or the students' questions), you would score the task according to the quality ranges outlined in the manual.

# (6.3)

Does answering thinking questions count as performing a thinking task?

Answering an open-ended question would count as performing a thinking task if the students perform a thinking task with their answer. For example, after reading a story, the teacher could ask: "How do you think the main character felt after losing the competition?” If a student responds, "I think he felt sad because he practiced very hard, and really wanted to win the competition", this would count as performing a substantial thinking task as the student is explaining their thinking. (refer to the Thinking Task Table for more examples of thinking tasks).

However, if the teacher asks an open-ended question and the students answer by simply repeating knowledge they've learned it would not be considered a thinking task. For example, the teacher may ask, "What happened after the main character lost the competition?", and a student says, "He cried", this would not count as a thinking task because the student is simply recalling information.

# TEACH TRAINING DAY 2-5

# Autonomy

# Terms

While many of the terms used in the Teach Manual might be clear to some trainees, others may need additional explanation to clarify uncertainty:

- “Roles in the classroom” — The extent to which students can participate in the lesson in a leadership capacity. This can take the form of doing administrative tasks or those directly related to the lesson.
- “Volunteering” — To take the initiative to participate in classroom activities. Students who take such initiative, regardless of whether the teacher asked them to participate or not, would be considered as volunteering.

# Explanation

Based on evidence from prior trainings, trainees reliably scored Autonomy 88.9% of the time. Coders were less reliable on behavior 7.3 (Medium). The behaviors trainees found most difficult are outlined below.26

# Troublesome Points

7.1 — Trainees generally do well with this behavior. This behavior is scored Low only if the teacher provides no explicit choices for the students. If the teacher provides choices, but they are superficial and not related to the learning objective, then this is scored Medium. For example, the teacher may provide students with the choice of math or reading to begin a lesson. Although the students are able to choose, this choice is not related to the learning objective.

Providing choices for administrative tasks, though not directly related to learning activity, is also scored as a Medium. For instance, the teacher may provide students with choices to work with pencils or pen, to write on notebook or board, to name a few. These are superficial choices and scored a Medium. This can be a sticking point as many trainees think this is still considered a Low score.

Tip — Listen for explicit language that denotes choice, such as: you choose, you may decide, which one you prefer, etc.

7.2 — Trainees generally do well with this behavior. The difference between a Medium and High is the quality of the roles the teacher provides. This behavior is scored Medium if the roles provided are superficial; these roles are often administrative (i.e. collecting a learning activity). To be scored High, students need to have a role in which they are responsible for at least part of a learning activity. For example, if a student goes up to the board to complete an equation but simply solves the equation and sits back down, this is a Medium as the student had no opportunity to lead others in learning.

Comparative percentages data was taken from the combined reliability scores from the Punjab, DC, and UVA trainings. It is fully recognized that data may be biased as trainees may change their scores to help them pass the certification exam (i.e., coding a 2 when they think should score a 1 to give themselves a “buffer” as reliable is defined as scoring within 1 value of the master code).

# COMMON AREAS OF CONFUSION: AUTONOMY

The student stands at the board and explains to the rest of the class how they solved the equation, the behavior is scored a High.

7.3 — Trainees are more likely to correctly score this behavior when it is a Low or High, but when the score is a Medium only 32% score correctly; 24% incorrectly score it Low and 44% incorrectly score it High.

Trainees may have difficulty identifying students volunteering to participate in the classroom. For example, the teacher may ask a question in class and students put their hands up to share their answers. This is considered students volunteering. Also, when the teacher covers a concept and students raise their hands to share their relevant experiences without being prompted, this situation is also considered student volunteering. These examples are considered Medium or High, with the scores shown below:

- Zero instances of students’ volunteering is scored as a Low.
- Less than 50% of students volunteer to participate is scored as a Medium.

Note — Even if one student volunteers to participate, this behavior is scored Medium.
- More than 50% of students to participate is scored as a High.

Note - All (or almost all) students don’t have to volunteer to be considered a High. To discern if most students volunteer, the number of students who volunteer should be averaged across the entire segment. For example, if the teacher asks the first question and all the students raise their hands, and then the second and third question only a couple students (less than ½) raise their hands, the average of the entire class would be less than ½ so it would be a Medium, not a High.

# Guiding Questions

- Does the teacher explicitly provide students with choices? 7.1
- Do the choices the teacher provides relate to the learning activity?
- Does the teacher ask students to come to the board? 7.2
- Do the students have opportunities to take on roles?
- Does the teacher give students responsibility for leading a learning activity?
- Does the majority of the class raise their hands? Or only a few? 7.3
- Do the students volunteer to speak even without being prompted by a question?

# Autonomy: FAQs

# (7.1a) Can an open-ended question/task count as providing students with choices?

If the teacher asks an open-ended question, this would likely not count as a choice. An open-ended task could be counted towards the teacher providing the students with choices if the teachers’ instructions explicitly imply s/he intends for the students to make a choice. For example, the teacher could say, "Select one of these topics for your essay”, or “You can decide which method to use to solve the problem.”

# (7.1b) How do I code this behavior if there is no clear learning objective?

If there is no stated learning objective or if the objective cannot be inferred from the learning activities, this behavior cannot be scored a high. It would be scored a medium if there is a choice presented and a low if there is no choice presented.

# (7.3a) What contributes as evidence towards volunteering?

What is being captured under this behavior is if the students are volunteering information, or if they are simply doing as required under a certain situation. Reciting information in call-and-response fashion or responding in unison to teachers' questions in a rehearsed or expected fashion — e.g., all students answering “yes” when the teacher asks, “Do you understand?” — does not count as volunteering to participate in the classroom.

Although the example in the manual is “students raise their hands”, students are also volunteering information when they answer questions without being called upon. Therefore, even if they don't raise their hands, if most students volunteer answers in response to the teacher's questions, this would still be H. For example, the teacher may ask, "Who knows the answer?", and most students call out their responses (with or without raising their hands), "Me!", "The answer is 5!", etc. then this would be scored H; if only few students answer, then it would be scored M.

# Terms

While many of the terms used in the Teach Manual might be clear to some trainees, others may need additional explanation to clarify uncertainty:

“Student Efforts” — These efforts refer to students’ efforts in the classroom. For example, the students’ effort on a worksheet, project, presentation, or other learning activities. Student efforts can refer to students’ growth, performance, presentation, mastery, etc.

# Explanation

Based on evidence from prior trainings, trainees reliably scored Perseverance 93% of the time. Coders were less reliable on behavior 8.2 (Low). The behaviors trainees found most difficult are outlined below.27

# Troublesome Points

8.1 — Trainees generally do well with this behavior. The key point here is that the teacher should focus on acknowledging students’ efforts (e.g., “I can tell you have worked so hard to solve this problem!”) rather than the results they achieved (e.g., “Nice job! You got all of these correct.”) or personal traits (e.g. “You are so smart”). The teacher’s acknowledgement should be process-oriented (i.e. focused on the students’ mastery or growth), not result-oriented (i.e. focused on students’ results, intelligence or natural abilities).

Remind trainees that there is a difference between acknowledging students’ efforts and acknowledging students’ positive behavior. Students’ efforts refer to the work they put in towards mastering new skills or concepts; positive behaviors are behaviors that meet or exceed the teacher’s behavioral expectations. If a teacher acknowledges students’ positive behavior, this would not count towards 9.1.

Note — There is also a difference between acknowledging students’ efforts and using positive language. Positive language may refer to students’ behavior, effort, skill, etc. Some positive language may be counted as acknowledging students’ efforts, however, positive language that does not refer to students’ efforts (i.e. “Good job! You are all sitting very quietly”) is not counted towards 8.1.

8.2 — Trainees generally do well with this behavior. Remember this behavior is scored a Medium when the teacher is neutral toward student challenges. This behavior is scored a Low only if the teacher has a negative attitude toward student challenges.

27 Comparative percentages data was taken from the combined reliability scores from the Punjab, DC, and UVA trainings. It is fully recognized that data may be biased as trainees may change their scores to help them pass the certification exam (i.e., coding a 2 when they think should score a 1 to give themselves a “buffer” as reliable is defined as scoring within 1 value of the master code). Note that the manual has changed for 8.1 since the trainings.

# TEACH TRAINING DAY 2-5

Negative attitudes toward student challenges may not always be explicit behaviors such as scolding or penalizing. This behavior includes being impatient or annoyed towards students for making mistakes or for asking questions to better understand a concept.

Tip — engage trainees in discussion on what a negative attitude could look like in the contexts they’ll be observing.

8.3 — Trainees are more likely to correctly score this behavior when it is a Low, but when the score is a Medium only 39% score correctly; 44% incorrectly score it Low and 18% incorrectly score it High.

As long as the teacher talks about goals or encourages students to set goals (no matter how briefly), this behavior is scored higher than a Low.

It is important to remind trainees that they should take note of subtler evidence. For example, a teacher may use instructional material to illustrate short-term or long-term goals, or use a story character's experiences to explain the importance of setting goals. This subtle evidence, that should be scored Medium, is more likely to be ignored by observers.

Trainees often miss when the teacher talks about goal setting in a general way, which should be scored Medium.

Tip - Listen for words and phrases such as, “this week,” “when you grow up,” or “next year” as these may indicate general goal setting.

# Guiding Questions

What does the teacher say when a student successfully produces a good piece of work, (i.e. gets a high score on a test, solves an equation correctly, etc.)? When a student is unsuccessful?

# 8.1

- Does the teacher explicitly recognize students’ efforts?
- Does the teacher focus on outcomes?
- Does the teacher focus on student intelligence?
- How does the teacher react to students when they face challenges in the classroom?
- Does the teacher scold the students?

# 8.2

- Is the teacher impatient or annoyed with the students?
- Does the teacher help the students with their challenges?
- Does the teacher say encouraging words to reassure students that frustration and failure are normal parts of the learning process?

# 8.3

- Does the teacher explicitly encourage students to set short-term or long-term goals?

# 8.2 Mozambique

The teacher has a negative attitude toward student challenges. Particularly, the teacher explicitly scolds a student who is behind: "Young man, you're behind! You haven't formed a single syllable! Not even one! Not yet!" The teacher also says, "Didn't you hear what your colleagues just said?" when a student makes a mistake. In addition, the teacher is constantly hurrying students saying, "What is taking so long" and "You're behind!”

# Philippines

The teacher has a neutral attitude toward students’ challenges in this segment. For example, there is evidence that students are struggling to get to the "right" answer during part of the segment and while the teacher does not help the students understand, the students are not penalized for mistakes either. The teacher helps them think about how they could tackle the challenge. For example, the teacher says, "We will repeat if you don't understand" and "That's ok, we're all still learning," giving evidence of a positive attitude towards challenges.

# Punjab

The teacher displays a negative attitude toward student challenges in this segment. The teacher is short with students who are struggling: "You are always left behind." The teacher is negative when correcting students on the procedure they’re supposed to follow. There are no apparent challenges, and so the teacher has no opportunity to exhibit any sort of attitude towards student challenges. This behavioral marker is, therefore, considered as neutral.

# 8.3 Mozambique

There is no evidence the teacher encourages students to set any learning goals. The teacher makes no mention of asking students how they would like to progress in their education, or anything they would like to improve upon in the future.

# Perseverance: FAQs

# (8.1a) What if the students do not seem to be making any effort in the class, how do I score this behavior?

If the teacher does not acknowledge any effort, even if s/he does not provide any tasks or questions that seem to challenge the students, or they don’t seem to be making any efforts this should still be scored low. As a teacher, there are always things students are doing or have done (recent homework for example) that can earn them acknowledgment for their efforts, even if it seemed to be easy for them.

# (8.1b) What is the difference between acknowledging students’ effort (8.1) and using positive language (1.2)?

Acknowledging students’ effort includes comments that focus specifically on the work and effort of the student. While acknowledging students’ effort may also count as positive language, a comment that constitutes positive language does not necessarily constitute acknowledging students’ effort. For example, "You have made so much progress on your writing! I can tell you have been practicing!" is a comment that would count towards positive language AND towards acknowledging students’ effort. "Good job!! You are such a fast writer!" is an example of positive language, but does NOT count towards acknowledging students’ effort.

# TEACH TRAINING DAY 2-5

(8.2a) If there is no mistake observed, how can I tell the teacher’s attitude towards challenges? As the three choices are low, neutral, and high, the teacher will always fit into one of those three categories. Any question could be a challenge so watching the teacher throughout the segment should provide enough information to code this behavior. If the teacher has a neutral attitude, does not get angry/impatient or is not scolding or penalizing students for making mistakes, then it is scored as a medium.

(8.2b) The teacher didn’t scold a student, but did seem annoyed; how would this be scored? The example of negative attitude towards challenges includes “scolding” however, it is important to consider other forms of negativity. It is important to take cultural differences into consideration (like for 1.1).

(8.2c) In scoring positive attitude towards student’s challenges, should I consider the “best” incident, or the average over the course of the segment? For this behavior, the observer should consider the average attitude of the teacher over the course of the segment. For example, the teacher might show a positive attitude towards students’ challenges when a student makes a mistake and the teacher says, “It’s ok, we’re learning.” However, if besides that isolated incident the teacher is consistently and explicitly scolding or becoming impatient with students, this would be scored a low or medium (depending on the balance of incidents over the segment). However, if there are no clear indications of a negative attitude, then one instance of a positive attitude is enough to make the score for this behavior a high.

# COMMON AREAS OF CONFUSION: SOCIAL AND COLLABORATIVE SKILLS

# Social and Collaborative Skills

# Terms

While many of the terms used in the Teach Manual might be clear to some trainees, others may need additional explanation to clarify uncertainty:

- “Collaborate Through Peer Interaction” — In the context of social and collaborative skills, collaboration through peer interaction can be any verbal or physical cooperative behavior that promotes a friendly and harmonious environment in class. It can take the form of students collaborating to solve a problem, or it can be more minor behaviors such as borrowing each other’s pencils.
- Superficial Collaboration — This type of collaboration occurs when students interact, but this is superficial and not related to the learning activity. Some examples of superficial collaboration are: sharing materials, greeting each other, talking to one another, etc.
- Substantial Collaboration — Students collaborate by working together to produce a product, solve a problem, complete a worksheet, or present a new idea.

# Explanation

Based on evidence from prior trainings, trainees reliably score Social and Collaborative Skills 95% of the time. Coders were less reliable on behaviors 9.2 (Medium). The behaviors trainees found most difficult are outlined below.28

# Troublesome Points

- 9.1 — There is no available data for this behavior. This behavior is scored a Medium if the teacher promotes superficial collaboration, whereas this behavior is scored a High if this promotion is substantial. Superficial collaboration tends to involve the teacher encouraging students to “share” something (i.e. opinions, materials, ideas, etc.). Substantial collaboration usually involves the teacher encouraging students to work together to produce a product, solve a problem, complete a worksheet, or present a new idea. For example, if the teacher assigns the students to groups and asks them to create two sentences using proper nouns to present to the class, this is considered substantial collaboration.
- 9.2 — Trainees are more likely to correctly score this behavior when it is a Low, but when the score is a Medium, only 38% score correctly; 51% incorrectly score it Low, and 11% incorrectly score it High. Trainees may ignore or miss evidence of the teacher briefly promoting interpersonal skills. For example, the teacher might give instructions for an activity and encourage students to share or help each other. Although this attempt to promote interpersonal skills is brief and the teacher does not explain why students should share or help, this attempt constitutes as a Medium.

28 Comparative percentages data was taken from the combined reliability scores from the Punjab, DC, and UVA trainings. It is fully recognized that data may be biased as trainees may change their scores to help them pass the certification exam (i.e., coding a 2 when they think should score a 1 to give themselves a “buffer” as reliable is defined as scoring within 1 value of the master code).

# TEACH TRAINING DAY 2-5

9.3 — Trainees are more likely to correctly score this behavior as a Low or a High, but when the score is a Medium, only 37% score correctly; 28% incorrectly score it Low, and 35% incorrectly score it High.

Trainees may have difficulty identifying superficial collaboration. This type of collaboration often occurs when students talk or share materials (i.e. a pencil, book, paper). These exchanges are often brief or not related to the learning activity (e.g. working together to produce a poem). Superficial collaboration is scored Medium, as long as any occurrence of negative behavior is minor or playful.

Use the following table for scoring:

| Students display strong negative behavior | Low                                                  | Low    | Low    |     |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------ | --- |
|                                           | Students display minor or playful negative behaviors | Medium | Medium | Low |
|                                           | Students do not display negative behaviors           | High   | Medium | Low |

# Guiding Questions

- Does the teacher provide an opportunity for the students to work in groups or pairs?
- Is the collaboration related to the learning activity?
- Is there evidence of teacher promoting perspective taking, empathizing, emotion regulation or social problem solving?

This behavioral marker is set to score interpersonal skills, and pets do not fit in that category.                                                                                                                        |

|                | This is some evidence the teacher promotes students' interpersonal skills, but this is brief and superficial. For example, when one student calls the other annoying the teacher intervenes and says, "Hey, it's a group, help each other." Again, the teacher reiterates that the students are to "help each other." The moments are brief and do not tackle higher-level interpersonal skills such as empathy or perspective-taking. |

|                | The teacher promotes students' interpersonal skills by acknowledging when a student is feeling anxious after going to the board and asking other students to encourage him. Specifically, she says "You are nervous, relax and have a second look", and then "Let’s encourage him. He’s too nervous." However, she does not talk about why one would want to encourage him or ask students to understand his perspective.              |

# Social and Collaborative Skills: FAQs

# (10.2) How could a teacher promote perspective-taking, empathizing, emotion regulation, and social problem-solving?

Perspective-taking refers to the ability to consider a situation from a different point of view. For example, a boy might get upset because his classmates excluded him from a game. The teacher could encourage perspective-taking by explaining to the boy that his classmates might not have known that he wanted to join in the game, and then encouraging him to ask them if he could participate.

Empathizing is the ability to recognize and share another’s emotions. For example, if a group of students are teasing a classmate, the teacher may promote empathizing by asking the group to consider how they would feel if they were the ones being teased.

Emotion regulation is the ability to effectively manage and respond to an emotional experience. For example, if a student is upset, the teacher may promote emotion regulation by providing strategies for the student to deal with his or her emotions, such as taking a deep breath or counting to 10.

Social problem-solving refers to the process that an individual goes through to solve an interpersonal problem. This may involve aspects of perspective-taking, empathizing, or emotion regulation. For example, if there is a problem between two students, the teacher may encourage social problem-solving by acknowledging the issue, recognizing the students’ emotions, and suggesting they brainstorm a solution together. The teacher may also intentionally model interpersonal skills; for example, the teacher may demonstrate how to stand up to a bully.

# TEACH TRAINING DAY 2-5

# PARTICIPANT SURVEY

At the end of the training (but before the Reliability Exam), it is important to administer the participant survey (which can be found in Training Package) to all the participants. The survey should take approximately half an hour. This survey collects information on the participants’ experience of the training and will provide valuable feedback to you as a trainer, as well as to the Teach team, about which aspects of the Teach training worked well, and where there may be areas for improvement in the future. Please scan the completed surveys and send it to teach@worldbank.org and your Teach Trainer as it will allow us to improve the training resources and the tool over time. All survey data should be submitted within one week of the completion of the training.

# PREPARING FOR THE EXAM: SAMPLE SCRIPT: TABLET TRAINING

# Reliability Exam

# PREPARING FOR THE EXAM

The training concludes with the Teach Reliability Exam and the presentation of Teach certificates to participants who pass the Reliability Exam. For the exam, all observers will be in the same room. Try to space them out as much as possible to minimize the chance of cheating or inadvertently looking at someone else’s answers. It is critical to explain and enforce a zero-tolerance policy on cheating, as it is important to ensure that participants who pass the Reliability Exam are truly reliably Teach observers.

# Sample Script: Tablet Training

Congratulations, you’ve made it through the Teach training! I know you have all learned a lot and now it is time to put it all together and take the Reliability Exam so you can become certified Teach observers. A couple of notes before we begin:

# NO CHEATING

We have a zero-tolerance policy on cheating. We are all sitting in this room together, but you are responsible for scoring your own codes for every behavior and element in each video. Any participant caught cheating will automatically fail the Reliability Exam and will not be allowed to carry out classroom observations using Teach. To avoid any misunderstandings, please keep your eyes on your own paper and avoid glancing towards others. Please do not talk to fellow participants during the exam; if you have any questions, please raise your hand and I will answer your question if I can.

Great, are you ready to do it on your own? I will now project 5 complete score sheets onto the screen, one at a time. You will have 15 minutes to enter the data for each scoresheet into your tablet. Make sure you are careful with your entries, so all the data is correctly recorded. If you have any questions, feel free to ask, this is not a test and we’re doing this to make sure you know how to correctly enter the data. That being said, do please ask me if you have a question and refrain from simply looking at your neighbors tablet.

[Project completed score sheets onto the screen one by one, allowing participants to enter the data on their tablet]

# RELIABILITY EXAM

The Reliability Exam consists of coding three, 15-minute videos. The videos will play from beginning to end with no pauses, and it will not be possible to replay a segment — just as if you were in a live observation. After the video is over, you will immediately start scoring. You will have 15 minutes to score; again, the maximum amount of time you will have when conducting live observations. If you finish early, make sure to double check that you have assigned a score for every behavior and every element. When the 15 minutes are over, you must turn in your scoresheet immediately. If you are not finished, your blank scores will be considered unreliable. Please go ahead and take a minute to write your name and coder ID (if assigned) on three scoresheets, label each scoresheet video 1²⁹, video 2, or video 3. We will not have a break during the Reliability Exam so if you need to use the restroom or get water you may do so once you are done preparing your scoresheets.

[Give participants a moment to prepare their scoresheets, make sure everyone is present before continuing]

You must pass the Reliability Exam in order to conduct live observations using Teach. As we mentioned the first day, to pass, you must be reliable on at least 80% (8 out of 10) of the elements for each video. For the Time on Learning element, you are considered reliable if you are in exact agreement with the master score for 2 out of the 3 snapshots. To be reliable on any one code for elements 1-9, your score must be within one of the master score. For example, if the master score is a 3, then scores of 2, 3, or 4 would be considered reliable. Remember, blank scores, including blank behavioral scores, will be considered unreliable. For example, even if you correctly score the element as a 3, if you fail to include a behavior score (a High, Medium, Low, or N/A), you will be considered unreliable for that entire element.

If you do not pass on their first attempt, you will be given feedback and allowed one additional opportunity to pass the exam. The second attempt will consist of 3 new videos and the same scoring rules will apply. Participants who fail both attempts will not be certified as Teach observers. For those of you who do pass, Teach observer certifications will be valid for 1 year.

Please be silent during the exam, ensure your cell phones are turned off, and refrain from distracting activities such as eating. Remember to refer to the manual often and do your best! Any questions? Let’s begin.

[Play video]

# DURING THE EXAM

— there will be no opportunity to pause, rewind, or replay part of the video. After the video, set a timer for 15 minutes. During the exam, for an ideal class size of 20 participants, always have one, ideally two, people present to monitor the room — one at the front and one at the back of the room. Scan the room to ensure that participants are completing the scoring on their own and are not obtaining information from one another. Ensure the room is consistently monitored for the duration of the exam.

For the exam, once everyone is ready, you will play the first video. Play the video from beginning to end without stopping. Participants have 15 minutes to code. If they are not finished within 15 minutes, they will be required to turn in their partially completed score sheets. Require participants to set down their pencils/pens as soon as 15 minutes are over and to turn in their completed score sheets before beginning the next video. Repeat this process for the next two videos, playing the video without stopping and giving participants 15 minutes to code. Do NOT give participants more than 15 minutes to code.

29 If videos have names, change video 1, video 2, and video 3 to video names.

# TEACH TRAINING MANUAL

# AFTER THE EXAM

If staffing permits, have a third, trainer present at the Reliability Exam as well. As soon as the first video is done, they should begin inputting scores into the Reliability Excel while participants continue taking the exam. However, if training personnel are limited and no one else is present to monitor the participants during the exam, priority must be placed on monitoring the participants to prevent cheating.

Any participant caught cheating will automatically fail the Reliability Exam and will not be allowed to complete the rest of the exam. The participant will also not be allowed to code classroom observations using Teach.

# AFTER THE EXAM

After each video, participants will turn in their scoresheets. You should check that the name and participant ID matches each person. If possible, after each video, participant scores should be entered into the Teach Reliability Excel file included in the Training Package. Finish entering the data of the videos into the Reliability Excel. After entering data from all three videos, the Reliability Excel file will show you who has passed and who has failed the Reliability Exam. Thus, ideally, a trained member from the World Bank should be the one to enter the data for the Reliability Exam to minimize the likelihood of errors in data entry. If a trained member from the World Bank is not present, do your best to accurately enter all the scores, not only for the elements, but also for each behavior.

The Teach Reliability Exam data should be sent, along with data from the participant survey, to teach@worldbank.org. Data should be sent within one week of the completion of the training. In the e-mail include where the training took place, the name of the trainers, and the participant names and IDs.

As mentioned above, participants who failed their first attempt will be given a second opportunity to pass the Reliability Exam. We recommend that participants who fail their first attempt are provided with a revision session prior to their second attempt at the exam. Use the Reliability Excel to check which elements or behaviors the participants struggled most with so that you can address these areas in the revision session. Participants should be given specific feedback on where they failed, problem areas should be discussed, and participants should be given the opportunity to ask any lingering questions to help clarify misunderstandings. If time and resources permit, consider offering another practice video for participants.

# AFTER THE EXAM

After the revision session, conduct the second round of the Reliability Exam. The process is the same as the first round (except the three videos must be different). Following the second Reliability Exam, make a list of participants who passed and those who failed both exams. Those who pass the second attempt will be fully certified Teach observers. Those who fail the second attempt, however, will not be certified and they will NOT be allowed to carry out classroom observations using Teach.

The Teach certificate for observers who pass the training is included in the Training Package. We recommend conducting a closing ceremony at the end of the training session to present the certificates (included in the Training Package) to the newly-certified Teach observers. If time is short, consider printing out the necessary certificates (ideally in color and on high quality paper) for all the participants ahead of time, and then destroy those for any participants who do not pass the Reliability Exam. Do NOT present certificates to participants who do not pass the Reliability Exam.

# GOING OUT INTO THE FIELD

While all participants who pass the Reliability Exam are certified, identify “stronger” and “weaker” observers, based on their performance on the practice videos (check your tracker) and on the Reliability Exam. This information should be shared with the person responsible for putting teams together to send out into the field. While only those who have passed the Reliability Exam go to the field to code, where possible, assign stronger coders to code independently. When pairs of observers code together (to allow for the assessment of inter-rater reliability), try to pair weaker observers with stronger observers.

Creating a WhatsApp (or similar messaging service) group with the observers is also recommended. This provides them with a simple and effective way to ask questions once they’re out in the field. It also provides you, the trainer, and other people overseeing the fieldwork with an efficient way of providing the observers with feedback as you receive data from the field.
