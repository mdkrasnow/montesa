# What does Teach measure?

Teach differs from other classroom observation tools in that it captures (i) the time teachers spend on learning and the extent to which students are on task, and (ii) the quality of teaching practices that help develop students’ socioemotional and cognitive skills.

As part of the Time on Task component, 3 “snapshots” of 1–10 seconds are used to record both the teacher’s actions and the number of students who are on task throughout the observation. The Quality of Teaching Practices component, on the other hand, is organized into 3 primary areas: Classroom Culture, Instruction, and Socioemotional Skills17 (see graphic on page 3). These areas have 9 corresponding elements that point to 28 behaviors. The behaviors are characterized as low, medium, or high, based on the evidence collected during the observation. These behavior scores are translated into a 5-point scale that quantifies teaching practices as captured in a series of two, 15-minute lesson observations.

# 1. CLASSROOM CULTURE:

The teacher creates a culture that is conducive to learning. The focus here is not on the teacher correcting students’ negative behaviors but rather the extent to which the teacher creates:

- (i) a supportive learning environment by treating all students respectfully, consistently using positive language, responding to students’ needs, and both challenging gender stereotypes and not exhibiting gender bias in the classroom; and
- (ii) positive behavioral expectations by setting clear behavioral expectations, acknowledging positive student behavior, and effectively redirecting misbehavior.

# 2. INSTRUCTION:

The teacher instructs in a way that deepens student understanding and encourages critical thinking and analysis. The focus here is not on content-specific methods of instruction, but rather the extent to which the teacher:

- (i) facilitates the lesson by explicitly articulating lesson objectives that are aligned to the learning activity, clearly explaining content, and connecting the learning activity to other content knowledge or students’ daily lives, and by modeling the learning activity through enacting or thinking aloud;
- (ii) does not simply move from one topic to the next but checks for understanding by using questions, prompts, or other strategies to determine students’ level of understanding, by monitoring students during group and independent work, and by adjusting his/her teaching to the level of students;
- (iii) gives feedback by providing specific comments or prompts to help clarify students’ misunderstandings or identify their successes; and
- (iv) encourages students to think critically by asking open-ended questions and providing students with thinking tasks that require them to actively analyze content. Students exhibit critical thinking ability by asking open-ended questions or performing thinking tasks.

# 3. SOCIOEMOTIONAL SKILLS:

The teacher fosters socioemotional skills that encourage students to succeed both inside and outside the classroom. To develop students’ social and emotional skills, the teacher:

- (i) instills autonomy by providing students with opportunities to make choices and take on meaningful roles in the classroom. Students exhibit their autonomy by volunteering to participate in classroom activities;
- (ii) promotes perseverance by acknowledging students’ efforts, rather than focusing solely on their intelligence or natural abilities, by having a positive attitude toward students’ challenges by framing failure and frustrations as part of the learning process, and by encouraging students to set short- and long-term goals; and
- (iii) fosters social and collaborative skills by encouraging collaboration through peer interaction and by promoting interpersonal skills, such as perspective taking, empathizing, emotion regulation, and social problem solving. Students exhibit social and collaborative skills by collaborating with one another through peer interaction.

# How was Teach developed?

To finalize a working version of the tool, the Teach development team rigorously researched, revised, and piloted different iterations of the tool over a 2-year timeframe:

1. The development team — which comprised 1 education measurement expert, 1 instructional expert, 1 psychologist, and 1 teacher — assessed 5 classroom observation tools widely used in the United States to create an inventory of teaching practices that are commonly evaluated.18 The team then built upon this list to include behaviors from international classroom observation tools used in developing countries.19 Based on this preliminary analysis, the team created an inventory of 3 areas and 43 elements.20
2. The development team hosted a working group of 22 education experts and practitioners to help further reduce and prioritize elements for the Teach framework. Participants were asked to indicate whether any elements were missing from the inventory, to rank the elements and areas by relevance, and to identify elements they characterized as unobservable. This process resulted in a downsized framework of 25 elements.
3. The development team reviewed the theoretical and empirical evidence from developing countries to further eliminate elements from the framework. This process resulted in a downsized framework of 14 elements.
4. These 14 elements comprised the first working version of the tool, which aimed to capture both quality and frequency of teaching practices as measured by each element.21 This preliminary tool was piloted in person in Pakistan and Uruguay and through classroom video footage in Afghanistan, China, Pakistan, the Philippines, Tanzania, Uruguay, and Vietnam. From these pilots, it became apparent that observers struggled to code reliably when they had to simultaneously capture the frequency and quality of teaching practices for each element. In response, the development team revised the structure of the tool to address this challenge. This process resulted in a tool comprised of 10 elements.
5. The development team convened a technical advisory panel, including Lindsay Brown, Pam Grossman, Heather Hill, Andrew Ragatz, Sara Rimm-Kaufman, Erica Woolway, and Nick Yoder, to provide written feedback on the tool. These comments were compiled and addressed as part of a 1-day technical workshop. During the workshop, the experts advised the team on which issues to prioritize and how to incorporate the comments to further improve the tool.
6. This updated version of the tool was applied in 4 settings, where observers were given a certification exam that ensured they could reliably code using Teach. In Mozambique, 74% of the observers passed the certification exam; in Pakistan and the Philippines, 96% passed; and in Uruguay, 100% passed. The observers also provided comments on the tool and training that was considered during the revision process.
7. The development team worked closely with Andrew Ho22 to analyze psychometric properties of the tool. Based on this analysis and feedback from the trainers and observers, the development team revised each element’s structure and complementary examples to improve the tool’s consistency and clarity. As part of this process, the Time on Learning element was modified to capture teachers’ time on instruction and students’ time on task through a series of snapshots. This process resulted in a tool that comprised 1 low-inference and 9 high-inference elements. The final stage involved testing these revisions using the Teach video library.

| **SUPPLIES:** Ensure you have the manual, observation packet, a pencil/pen, consent forms,²³ and a watch/phone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | **SETUP:** Sit toward the back of the classroom to view the entire classroom; ensure your presence does not block students’ view of the lesson.                                                                                                                                                    | **CONCLUSION:** Thank the teacher for being able to conduct the observation. When the lesson concludes, remove yourself from the classroom and finish coding in a different location to mitigate distractions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **ARRIVAL:** Introduce yourself to the principal and arrive at the designated classroom at least 10 minutes before class begins. Introduce yourself to the teacher, explain the purpose of the visit, and remind the teacher of the confidential nature of the observation:> “Good morning, Mr./Ms. \[teacher’s surname], I work with \[affiliate organization]. Your school has been randomly selected to partake in a survey that includes classroom observations. The purpose of the survey is to learn about teaching practices in \[district/city name]. As such, I’m here to simply learn from you — these observations will not be used for evaluative purposes, and your identity will remain entirely confidential. Please proceed with the lesson as you normally would.” | **OBSERVATION:** Begin the observation when class is scheduled to begin; if the teacher is delayed, wait until s/he arrives and make note of the time on the observation sheet. In the case of multigrade classrooms, treat the observation as one grade and document it on the observation sheet. | **DISCRETION:** Avoid discussing any of the scores with the teacher. If a teacher asks how s/he performed, politely remind him/her this is not a performance evaluation. For example:> “The goal of the observation was to learn about teaching practices; the notes from this observation will be used as part of a larger study on teaching practices in \[district/city name]. I very much enjoyed watching your lesson and appreciate you allowing me into your classroom.”Refrain from discussing the classroom scores with anyone. You can provide your supervisor’s number if the teacher insists. |
| **DISSENT:** If a teacher does not want to be observed, kindly remind him/her that the observation is not an evaluation, his/her identity will be kept anonymous, and no information about the observation will be shared with school authorities. Kindly note, a teacher cannot be forced to be observed; if the teacher continues to decline consent, exit the classroom and document what happened on the observation sheet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **NO INTERACTION:** Avoid engaging with or distracting the students or teacher and do not participate in classroom activities, even if explicitly asked. Do not check students’ textbooks, worksheets, notebooks, or other classwork. Avoid positive or negative nonverbal expressions and convey a neutral attitude to avoid inadvertently distracting the teacher. Redirect the teacher and students to the lesson if they ask questions or focus their attention on your presence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

# Length of the observation

Observations should be divided into two, 15-minute segments.24 The first observation segment begins at the scheduled class time; however, if the teacher or students are not present during the scheduled class time or the lesson is delayed, the observation begins when the teacher enters the classroom. After each 15-minute observation, observers should spend 10–15 minutes scoring the observation, depending on the length of the class. For example, in a 45-minute class, the first observation segment begins at the scheduled class time and is 15 minutes in length. The observer then stops (even though class is still going) and spends the next 15 minutes scoring segment 1. The observer then spends the remaining 15 minutes of class observing segment 2. After the class has concluded, the observer spends another 15 minutes scoring segment 2. Observers should always record the length of each observation segment on the scoring sheet. If the lesson ends before the predetermined length of the observation, observers should still code the segment. It is important to accurately record the information on segment length, delayed starts, and early finishes, as this will be used in data analysis.

Once the observation begins, the observer uses the note-taking form to document what the teacher says by noting specific behaviors, questions, instructions, and actions. These notes are essential to code objectively and reliably, since they provide evidence for the chosen scores. When note-taking, it is important to be as descriptive as possible. Observers will use their notes and compare them with the descriptions in the manual to determine the behavior quality ranges and assign an overall combined score for each element. As soon as observers finish an observation, every score should be justified with evidence from the observation. When note-taking, it is important to look for specific student and teacher behaviors that are clearly included in the tool. All observers should create a note-taking system that works for them; below are some helpful note-taking techniques.25

| SCRIPTING: | After a lesson on forming past tense sentences, the teacher asks students to relate the current lesson to a previous one on action verbs by forming a sentence using both strategies. She asks, “Who can take an action verb from yesterday and create a past tense sentence?” A student raises her hand and responds, “Amna jumped over the puddle.” | T: Who can take an action verb from yesterday and create a past tense sentence? S: Amna jumped over the puddle. |
| TALLIES:   | Throughout the lesson, the teacher says “very good” 8 times in response to student participation and answers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | “Very good”                                                                                                     |
| SHORTHAND: | The teacher reviews a student’s paragraph and provides feedback by saying, “Great job on the first paragraph. The way you open with a personal story is very compelling.”                                                                                                                                                                             | FB- T: opening paragraph is compelling b/c of personal story                                                    |
| ANECDOTES: | At the start of an activity, the teacher asks if everyone has a textbook. Six students raise their hands to indicate they do not. The teacher continues teaching at the board. Meanwhile, 3 students are playing with a ball of paper and distracting others.                                                                                         | 6 Ss no book, T cont. teaching at board, 3 Ss playing (disruptive).                                             |

The tool does not exist without the manual; the tool is constituted by the observer manual and observation sheet; observers should actively use and read the manual to determine scores.

# Measuring Time on Task

For the Time on Learning element, observers will take 3 “snapshots,” or 1–10 second scans of the classroom, and use only information gathered during the snapshot to code the behaviors. For the first behavior, observers will record whether the teacher is providing a learning activity for most students by indicating “no” if s/he is not providing a learning activity and “yes” if s/he is. If the teacher is providing a learning activity, scan the classroom from left to right to determine whether students are on task. If 0 or 1 student is off task, score the second behavior high(H). If 2 to 5 students are off task, score it medium(M). If 6 or more students are off task, score it a low(L). If the teacher does not provide a learning activity for most students, record a “not applicable” (N/A) for the second behavior and continue coding the other elements of the tool. See Page 17 for more details on the snapshot method and how to code this element.

# Separation of Elements

In some cases, separating the content of the elements can feel forced since everything that happens in the classroom is interconnected; that is, observers may strongly feel an action falls under more than 1 element. One observed action can serve as evidence for more than 1 Teach behavior or element, but the scoring of each must be done independently. For example, a teacher may provide feedback during the lesson so students reflect on their mistakes. This feedback may encourage students to think critically; however, this does not mean the teacher automatically scores high on the critical thinking element, since other behaviors in the critical thinking element may be absent. In this case, observers should keep both elements separate and score them independently.

# Weighing of Specific Events or First Impressions

In some cases, observers may witness a situation that surprises them or triggers a negative or positive impression. This incident may influence how they assess the entire observation. To maintain reliability, it is important to consider the event in the broader context of the observation and not let first impressions or salient events disproportionately influence the overall score. Therefore, observers should write detailed notes of the observation to determine how much weight to give a specific event.

Additionally, each segment should be considered in-and-of itself, and observers should focus on what occurs in the current segment. For instance, even if the teacher intends to do an activity later in the class, it is important for observers to only score what actually happens in that segment, rather than boosting the score of 1 of the behaviors based on an intention that never occurred. This is particularly applicable for distinguishing what occurs in segment 1 versus segment 2 (i.e., what is observed in segment 1 may not be considered for scoring in segment 2, and vice versa).

# Central Tendency

In some cases, observers assign medium-level scores more often than they should. This reluctance to assign high or low scores occurs (i) when observers are not confident in their ability to identify the appropriate level, or believe that high or low scores are very rare and are largely unattainable; or (ii) due to the fear (for themselves or the teacher) of assigning more extreme scores. It is important observers score the behaviors exactly as defined in the manual without being influenced by how the scores may be used or how they reflect on the observer or the teacher.

# Observer certification and Reliability Exam

A training participant must pass the Teach Reliability Exam before becoming a certified reliable Teach observer. Observer certification provides quality control and increases reliability of the Teach tool across observers. It ensures all certified observers can use the tool to accurately and consistently score classroom observations in accordance with the Teach scale.

The Teach Reliability Exam consists of watching and scoring three, 15-minute video segments and scoring them according to the Teach rubric. Participants have 15 minutes to code each segment and cannot stop, rewind, or rewatch the videos during the exam. To pass the exam, participants must be reliable on 8 of the 10 elements for each segment. For example, if an observer scores 100% on the first segment, 100% on the second segment, and 70% on the third segment, s/he would not pass the exam.

For the Time on Learning element, participants are considered reliable if they are in exact agreement with the master score for 2 out of the 3 snapshots. For all the other elements, participants are considered reliable if they score within 1 point of the master score. Participants who do not pass on the first attempt will be given feedback and allowed 1 additional opportunity to pass the exam. The second exam will consist of 3 different videos. Participants who do not pass the second attempt will not be certified as Teach observers. Teach certification is valid for 1 year.

17. It should be noted that it is impossible to draw a clear line between teaching practices linked to academic versus socioemotional learning. Many teaching practices included in common professional teaching frameworks do impact students’ socioemotional development, but are usually thought of in terms of academic rather than socioemotional learning. Explicitly linking teaching practices with socioemotional outcomes in measures used for assessment will serve to increase the salience of students’ socioemotional skills to teachers, as well as to other stakeholders and policy makers, thus ensuring a focus on both academic and socioemotional learning in the classroom.
18. The Teach framework built upon the inventory created by Gill and others (2016), who conducted a content analysis of the differences in dimensions of instructional practice of 5 commonly used classroom observation tools comparing the behaviors they measure with the extent to which they predict student learning. The tools included CLASS, FFT, PLATO, Mathematical Quality of Instruction, and UTeach Observational Protocol. The content, predictive power, and potential bias of these instruments were also analyzed as part of this preliminary framework (Gill, Brian, Megan Shoji, Thomas Coen, and Kate Place. 2016. “The Content, Predictive Power, and Potential Bias in Five Widely Used Teacher Observation Instruments.” National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance, Washington, DC.
19. These included OPERA, SCOPE, SDI, Stallings, and TIPPS.
20. Elements refer to groups of multiple, similar behaviors that aim to capture teaching practices related to positive learning outcomes.
21. For example, the tool aimed to capture not just the quality with which a teacher checked for understanding (adjusting the lesson, prompting students to determine their level of understanding, etc.), but the frequency with which the teacher checked for understanding in each lesson.
22. Andrew Ho is Professor of Education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. He is a psychometrician whose research aims to improve the design, use, and interpretation of test scores in education policy and practice.
23. Protocol to enter the classroom may vary from context to context; however, it is important to have the necessary approvals in place before arriving at the school.
24. These times may differ slightly from context to context.

The teacher maximizes time on learning by ensuring most students are on task and provided with a learning activity most of the time. This can be observed in the classroom through the following behaviors:

| YES                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | NO                      |   |

| This includes any activity that is related to class content, independent of its quality. For example, learning activities can include a teacher lecturing, small group/team work, or students working on a worksheet or reading independently. Note that if the teacher leaves the classroom, but has provided students with a learning activity, this would still count as a learning activity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | NONLEARNING ACTIVITIES: |   |
| This includes any activity that is not related to class content, including activities related to classroom management such as taking attendance or disciplining students or any other activity that leaves students waiting. For example, when the teacher is silently writing on the board without asking students to copy. Other examples of nonlearning activities include: when a teacher takes attendance, s/he may read the children’s names individually; when there are misbehaviors, s/he may stop the lesson to redirect student misbehavior; when there are outside disruptions, s/he may stop teaching to see what is going on; when checking homework, s/he may check each student’s homework individually, while the other students wait with nothing to do. In addition, basic classroom processes may be prolonged, such as transitioning to a new activity, getting materials ready for a lesson, or completing administrative tasks. |                         |   |

Students off task:

This includes students who are not participating in the learning activity provided by the teacher either because they are quiet but distracted, or because they are disrupting the class. For example, in the first category, students may be staring out the window, resting their head on the desk, looking down to the floor or at the observer, or sleeping. In the second category, they may be passing notes, whispering, talking to another student during an activity that does not require talking, moving around the class, shouting, or in any other way disrupting the class.

# 1.1

The teacher does not treat all students respectfully. For example: The teacher may yell at some students, scold them, shame/ridicule them, or use physical punishment to discipline them.

The teacher treats all students somewhat respectfully. For example, the teacher does not treat students disrespectfully (e.g., s/he does not yell at or ridicule students), but the teacher does not show outward signs of respect toward students either (e.g., call students by their names, say “please” or “thank you,” or other culturally relevant signs of respect).

The teacher treats all students respectfully. For example: The teacher uses students’ names, says “please” and “thank you,” or shows some other culturally relevant sign of respect.

# 1.2

The teacher does not use positive language in his/her communication with students.

The teacher uses some positive language in his/her communication with students. For example: The teacher may say “well done” or “good”, although this happens infrequently.

The teacher consistently uses positive language in his/her communication with students. For example: The teacher consistently uses encouraging phrases such as “Great job!” when students show their work to him/her, or “You can do this!”, or “You are such a talented group of children.”

# 1.3

The teacher is not aware of students’ needs OR does not address the problem at hand. For example: A student may not have the required supplies for the lesson, and the teacher does not notice or sees it and ignores it.

The teacher responds to students’ needs but may not address the problem at hand. For example: A student may be upset because s/he does not have a pencil, and the teacher asks another child to share his/her pencil, but s/he refuses. The teacher carries on with the lesson without solving the problem.

The teacher promptly responds to students’ needs in a way that specifically addresses the problem at hand. For example: If a student does not have a pencil, the teacher allows the child to borrow one from his/her spare pencil box.

# 1.4

The teacher exhibits gender bias or reinforces gender stereotypes in the classroom. The teacher could show this by providing students with unequal opportunities to participate in classroom activities, or by expressing unequal expectations for students’ behaviors or capabilities.

The teacher does not exhibit gender bias, but does not challenge gender stereotypes either. The teacher provides children of all genders with equal opportunities to participate in the classroom and has similar expectations for all students.

The teacher does not exhibit gender bias and challenges gender stereotypes in the classroom. For example: The teacher assigns cleaning tasks to children of all genders, and calls equally on all genders to answer difficult questions. In addition, the teacher uses examples and explanations that portray female rather than male scientists, doctors, and astronauts.

2 Only verbal communication is counted as positive language; nonverbal displays of positive language would not count toward this behavior.

3 This behavior is scored as N/A if there are no observable emotional, material, or physical needs.

4 The chances to participate should be considered proportionally to the ratio of different genders in the classroom; this behavior is only applicable in mixed-gender classrooms.
---
# A.2 CLASSROOM CULTURE

# POSITIVE BEHAVIORAL EXPECTATIONS

The teacher promotes positive behavior in the classroom. The teacher promotes positive behavior by acknowledging students’ behavior that meets or exceeds expectations. Moreover, the teacher sets clear behavioral expectations for different parts of the lesson. This can be observed in the classroom through following behaviors:

| Score                  | 1                                                                             | 2                                                                                    | 3                                                                           | 4 | 5 |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | - | - |
| Behavior Quality Range | In this classroom, the teacher is ineffective at promoting positive behavior. | In this classroom, the teacher is somewhat effective at promoting positive behavior. | In this classroom, the teacher is effective at promoting positive behavior. |   |   |

# 2.1

The teacher sets clear behavioral expectations for classroom activities. The teacher does not set behavioral expectations for classroom tasks and/or activities. For example: The teacher says, “Work on your reading comprehension skills,” without providing instruction on what the expected behavior is for the activity.

For example: When introducing a group activity, the teacher says, “Please sit in your preassigned groups and behave,” without clarifying what such behavior would entail. For example: Upon introducing a group activity to the class, the teacher explicitly states the expected behavior for students in the group. This may include, “Use a quiet indoor voice” or “Take turns speaking.” If students are working independently, the teacher gives directions on what to do when they complete the activity. The teacher says, “Please quietly get up, bring your worksheet to me, and read while you wait for your classmates to finish.” Alternatively, the teacher is not observed setting clear behavioral expectations, but students are well-behaved throughout the lesson.

# 2.2

The teacher acknowledges positive student behavior that meets or exceeds expectations. The teacher does not acknowledge student behavior that meets or exceeds expectations. The teacher acknowledges some students’ behavior, but is not specific about their expected behavior. For example: If a group is following behavioral expectations, the teacher says, “This group is working well together” or “This group is doing a good job,” without clarifying why or how.

For example: A teacher says to the class, “I just noticed that members of Group A are taking turns to speak and are proactively working on the next assignment.”

# 2.3

The teacher redirects misbehavior and focuses on the expected behavior, rather than the undesired behavior. Redirection of misbehavior is ineffective and focuses on misbehaviors, rather than the expected behavior. For example: If s/he notices a distracted student, the teacher stops lecturing and calls out the name of the student, asking her, “Why are you not paying attention in class?” Alternatively, the teacher continues to ignore the distracted student, but the distracted student begins to tease and argue with the peer sitting next to her. This shifts the focus of the entire class away from the lesson and onto those 2 students.

When a problem arises, redirection of misbehavior effectively addresses the problem at hand and focuses on the expected behavior. For example: If students are talking loudly and being disruptive during a lesson, the teacher says, “Remember to use quiet voices,” and the students quiet down. Alternatively, the teacher is not observed redirecting students’ behavior, but the students are well-behaved throughout the lesson.

5A misbehavior occurs when a student causes a disruption in the classroom that either interferes with the flow of the lesson, distracts other students, or upsets the teacher.

The teacher facilitates the lesson to promote comprehension.

# LESSON

The teacher facilitates the lesson to promote comprehension by explicitly articulating the objectives, providing clear explanations of concepts, and connecting the lesson with other content knowledge or students’ experiences. This can be observed in the classroom through the following behaviors:

| Score | Behavior | Quality |                                                                                                    |

| 3     | HIGH     |         |                                                                                                    |

# 3.1

The teacher explicitly articulates the objectives of the lesson and relates classroom activities to the objectives.

For example: The teacher asks students to take turns reading a text about planting and harvesting crops. S/he then spends the rest of the lesson discussing farming and the specific processes involved. The teacher does not state a lesson objective, and it is difficult to infer a lesson objective from the activities as the objective could be developing oral reading fluency, developing vocabulary, or learning about agriculture.

# 3.2

The teacher’s explanation of content is clear.

For example: The teacher uses too many technical terms without explaining what s/he means and/or may explain ideas without a logical order or connection. Moreover, the teacher may say, “A fraction is a combination of a numerator and denominator,” without saying what either of those words mean. Alternatively, the teacher may not provide any explanation of content.

# 3.3

The teacher makes connections in the lesson that relate to other content knowledge or students’ daily lives.

For example: When teaching a class on fractions, the teacher relates the content to students’ experiences by asking, “Who has had to slice a birthday cake? How did you make sure there were enough slices for everyone?” Learning about fractions can help us divide a cake between people.

# 3.4

The teacher models by enacting or thinking aloud.

For example: In an English class where the objective of the activity is to write a paragraph, the teacher only demonstrates how to write a topic sentence. In a math class, the teacher shows (enacts) how to draw a bar graph, but does not clarify how s/he extracted the data from the text to create the bar graph.

Modeling can take place at any time in the lesson (including at the end). If the learning activity is procedural in nature, modeling will include an enactment of the procedure for children to observe; however, if the activity focuses on developing a thinking skill, a complete model will include a think aloud. An action is considered modeling so long as the teacher demonstrates/enacts procedures or thinking processes related to the learning activity.

# B.4 INSTRUCTION CHECKS FOR UNDERSTANDING

The teacher checks for understanding for most students. The teacher checks for understanding to ensure most students comprehend the lesson content. Moreover, the teacher adjusts the pace of the lesson to provide students with additional learning opportunities. This can be observed in the classroom through the following behaviors:

| Score    | 1                                                                              | 2                                                                                           | 3                                                                                         | 4    | 5 |

| Range    | In this classroom, the teacher does not check for any student’s understanding. | In this classroom, the teacher is effective at checking only a few students’ understanding. | In this classroom, the teacher is effective at checking for most students’ understanding. |      |   |

# 4.1 The teacher uses questions, prompts, or other strategies to determine students’ level of understanding

The teacher either does not ask questions/prompt students at all OR when s/he does, the class responds in synchrony, which is accepted without further clarifying for understanding. For example: When explaining a concept, the teacher asks, “Have you all understood?” The students in the class respond in unison, “Yes, we have.” Another example is that the teacher inquires, “This is correct, right?” after completing a problem set. The class or an individual student replies, “Yes, this is correct.”

The teacher uses questions, prompts, or other strategies that are effective at determining only a few students’ level of understanding. For example: The teacher asks, “What is 7+8?” Only a few students respond by raising their hand, a group from which the teacher calls upon 1 or 2 students to provide an answer. Alternatively, the teacher asks the question but does not ask students to raise their hands in response and simply allows students to willingly volunteer their answers.

For example: The teacher says, “Please put your thumb up if you agree or down if you disagree with this statement: Equilateral triangles have equal angles.” The teacher also asks students to demonstrate their knowledge by having all students share their answers, e.g., by asking each student to read out the sentence s/he wrote using past tense verbs.

# 4.2 The teacher monitors most students during independent/group work

The teacher does not monitor students when they are working independently or in groups. For example: The teacher sits at his/her desk or remains standing in front of the class when students are working.

The teacher monitors some students when they are working independently or in groups to check their understanding. For example: The teacher observes some student work for accuracy, clarifies concepts, or asks questions.

The teacher systematically monitors most students by circulating the classroom and approaching individual students or groups to check their understanding. For example: When students are working, the teacher walks around the classroom, making sure to approach students or groups in a systematic way. The teacher observes most students’ work, clarifies concepts, and asks questions.

# 4.3 The teacher adjusts teaching to the level of students

The teacher does not adjust teaching for students. The teacher slightly adjusts teaching, but this adjustment is brief and superficial. For example: As students complete an alphabet worksheet, the teacher notices they are not dotting their ‘i’s. In response, s/he briefly reminds the class to dot their ‘i’s.

The teacher substantially adjusts teaching for students. When students have misconceptions, the teacher may initiate back and forth exchanges to help them understand all points of misunderstanding, which provides students with more opportunities to learn. The teacher may also provide more challenging tasks for those who already have an advanced understanding.

For example: As students complete an alphabet worksheet, the teacher notices they are not dotting their ‘i’s. In response, s/he briefly stops the activity and reviews the differences between capital and lower case ‘i’s before continuing with the alphabet activity. Alternatively, if the teacher notices that a student has already completed the worksheet, s/he may give that student another activity to complete while waiting for the rest of the class.

7 This behavior is scored as N/A if there is no observable group or independent work.

8 Even if there is no perceived need for adjusting, if the teacher does not adjust teaching, this behavior is scored as low.

# INSTRUCTION

The teacher provides feedback to deepen student understanding.

# FEEDBACK

The teacher provides specific comments or prompts9 to help identify misunderstandings, understand successes, and guide thought processes to promote learning. This can be observed in the classroom through the following behaviors:

| Score         | 1                                                                                                      | 2                                                                                                             | 3                                                                                                           | 4 | 5 |

# 5.1

The teacher provides specific comments or prompts that help clarify students’ misunderstandings.

For example: In a math class, the teacher says, “You forgot to include the negative sign,” without providing further information or prompts. For example, the teacher says, “Do you remember what happens when we multiply a positive and a negative number? Let’s look at your notes. Now, let’s look at your answer. What do you need to change to find the correct answer?”

# 5.2

The teacher provides specific comments or prompts that help identify students’ successes.

For example: If students are writing stories as part of an assignment, the teacher says, “Good job on the third paragraph,” without specifying what that particular student did that made it good. For example: If students are writing stories, the teacher says, “You do a good job getting the reader interested in this paragraph when you write ‘no one knew what would happen.’ This sentence makes me want to read more.” Alternatively, the teacher highlights one student’s work and says to the class, “Look at the work of this classmate, see how s/he used the number line to solve this subtraction problem?,” and then proceeds to explain how the student solved it.

9 Prompts are pieces of information, such as guiding hints or questions, which are given by the teacher and encourage students to think through misunderstandings or identify successes.

# B.6 INSTRUCTION

# CRITICAL THINKING

The teacher builds students’ critical thinking skills by encouraging them to actively analyze content. This can be observed in the classroom through the following behaviors:

| Score         | 1                                                                                     | 2                                                                                            | 3                                                                                   | 4 | 5 |

| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Behavior | The teacher does not ask open-ended questions OR asks only 1 open-ended question. | The teacher asks students at least 2 open-ended questions but does not build on student responses, OR the teacher asks 2 open-ended questions and 1 of them is a follow-up to a student response. | The teacher asks students 3 or more open-ended questions AND at least 1 of them builds upon student responses by asking students to justify their reasoning, further explain, or clarify their ideas. |

For example: The teacher asks, “How do you think the main characters in the story would prepare for the competition?” After a student responds, the teacher then follows up by asking, “What facts or ideas make you think that?” Then s/he asks another student, “What do you think happens next?” In a math class, the teacher asks, “How do you know -2 is greater than -6?” After the student responds, the teacher follows up by asking, “What would happen if the numbers were positive?” Later in the lesson, the teacher asks, “How do you use the number line to determine if –8 or –4 is greater?”

# 6.2 The teacher provides thinking tasks

The teacher provides thinking tasks that require students to actively analyze content, as opposed to simply receiving information or building fluency (i.e., rote learning).

| Behavior | The teacher does not provide thinking tasks. Classrooms with no thinking tasks include those where students simply listen to the teacher or perform rote tasks. | The teacher provides superficial thinking tasks. Superficial thinking tasks are tasks such as matching sets of items, identifying concepts or key pieces of information, and comparing and contrasting characteristics. They also include applying learned information or techniques to tasks similar to those the teacher has already demonstrated. | The teacher provides substantial thinking tasks. Substantial thinking tasks are tasks such as making predictions, identifying patterns, explaining thinking, making connections, and interpreting information. They also include applying learned information or techniques to new tasks the teacher has not demonstrated. |

| 1. Learning about numbers          | The teacher has students memorize numbers 1–100.                                                                                 | Students compare numbers based on size and organize them by descending or ascending order. For example, the teacher writes 8, 29, 72, 63, and 7 on the board. S/he tells students to write the numbers in ascending order. Alternatively, the teacher tells students, "Look at this set of numbers: 2, 5, 10, 19, 24. Write down in 2 columns which are even numbers and which are odd numbers."                         | The teacher puts sequences of numbers on the board and has students find the patterns. For example, the teacher writes the following 3 number sequences on the board: 3, 13, 17, 23; 6, 15, 24, 30, 36; and 4, 12, 28, 32, 40. S/he then tells students to identify what each group has in common.                                                                     |
| 2. Learning about subtraction      | Students listen to the teacher explain the concept and then copy the examples from the board.                                    | The teacher explains the process of subtraction. She then asks students to complete several subtraction problems (e.g., “What's 10-5?") and to write their answers in their notebooks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | The teacher explains the process of subtraction. The teacher then writes a “menu” on the board including prices. The teacher has students imagine they have $20 and asks them to figure out how much change they would receive from buying different items.                                                                                                            |
| 3. Learning about bar graphs       | Students listen to the teacher explain the concept and then copy the examples from the board.                                    | In a lesson on bar graphs, the teacher uses a chart of numbers and draws a bar graph showing the class's favorite foods. S/he then asks students, "Which bar is tallest? Which bar is the shortest?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | In a lesson on bar graphs, the teacher draws a bar graph showing the class's favorite foods. S/he then asks students to work in pairs to interpret the information to identify and rank foods from the most preferred to the least preferred. S/he then tells them to calculate how many more students prefer the most preferred compared to the least preferred food. |
| 4. Learning about fractions        | Students are told to repeat the definition of a fraction to their neighbor.                                                      | In a lesson on fractions, students are given pieces of paper cut into various shapes and are instructed to fold the paper into various shapes that represent fractions. The teacher shows them how to fold into various fractions and then, having them work in pairs, says, "One of you will fold your paper into 1/5, the other will fold your paper into 1/3. Then, whoever has the larger fraction should stand up." | The teacher tells students to fold a piece of paper into sixths. Then s/he says, "Color in 3/6ths of your paper. Write down the fraction of the colored part of the paper and see how many other fractions you can write that represent this area. What patterns do you identify among the fractions?”                                                                 |
| 5. Finding the area of a rectangle | The teacher calculates the area of 3 different rectangles on the board and has students copy the information in their notebooks. | After explaining how to find the area of a rectangle, the teacher draws a rectangle on the board, gives measurements, and has students use formulas they know to determine the area.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | After learning how to find the area of a rectangle, students are asked to compute the area of the classroom, which is in the shape of a rectangle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 6. Solving word problems           | The teacher writes a word problem on the board and shows students how to solve it.                                               | The teacher writes a word problem on the board and shows students how to solve it. The teacher then gives students a set of word problems to solve.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | The teacher writes a word problem on the board and shows students how to solve it. The teacher then gives students a set of word problems to solve. The teacher calls on students to explain how they solved the different problems.                                                                                                                                   |

# C.7 SOCIOEMOTIONAL SKILLS AUTONOMY

The teacher allows students to make choices and encourages students to participate in the classroom. The teacher provides students with opportunities to make choices and take on meaningful roles in the classroom. Students make use of these opportunities by volunteering to take on roles and expressing their ideas and opinions throughout the lesson. This can be observed in the classroom through the following behaviors:

| Score    | 1   | 2      | 3    | 4 | 5 |
| -------- | --- | ------ | ---- | - | - |
| Behavior | LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH |   |   |

Quality Range

In this classroom, the teacher is ineffective at developing students’ autonomy.

In this classroom, the teacher is somewhat effective at developing students’ autonomy.

In this classroom, the teacher is effective at developing students’ autonomy.

# 7.1

The teacher does not explicitly provide students with choices. The teacher provides students with choices without providing different options for how students can approach the task. For example: Students are asked to complete a set of math problems following a prescribed set of steps. Alternatively, the teacher tells students to write sentences without providing intentional choices.

The teacher explicitly provides students with at least 1 superficial choice that is not related to the learning objective. For example: The teacher allows students to choose between different colored pencils to complete an assignment, decide where to sit in the classroom when completing a task, choose the order in which to complete the activities, or vote on which student presentation was the best.

The teacher explicitly provides students with at least 1 substantive choice that is related to the learning objective. For example: The teacher allows students to choose between writing an essay or doing a presentation about their favorite sport. In a science class, the teacher lets students choose an animal to investigate.

# 7.2

The teacher does not provide students with opportunities to take on roles in the classroom. For example: The lesson is primarily lecture-based and highly structured; subsequently, students’ participation is limited to copying down information. In this lesson, students never get the chance to come to the board or read a text.

The teacher provides students with opportunities to take on limited roles in the classroom. For example: Students take attendance, assign tasks, pass out materials, or write on the board. Limited roles also include housekeeping tasks such as fetching water, wiping the board, or cleaning the classroom.

The teacher provides students with opportunities to take on meaningful roles in the classroom, in which they are responsible for parts of a learning activity. For example: The teacher gives a student the opportunity to solve an equation on the board and explain to the class how s/he tackled the main challenges of the problem.

# 7.3

Students do not volunteer to participate in the classroom.

Only a few students volunteer to participate by expressing their ideas and taking on roles. For example: When the teacher asks a question, only a few students put their hand up to answer; later when the teacher asks another question, the same few students put their hand up.

Most students volunteer to participate by expressing their ideas and taking on roles. For example: When the teacher asks a question, many students put their hand up to share their answers. The students could also volunteer without the teacher asking (e.g., a student offers to share a related experience when the teacher is explaining a concept).

# C.8 SOCIOEMOTIONAL SKILLS

# PERSEVERANCE

The teacher promotes students’ efforts, has a positive attitude toward challenges, and encourages goal setting. The teacher promotes students’ efforts toward the goal of mastering new skills or concepts, instead of focusing solely on results, intelligence, or natural abilities. In addition, the teacher has a positive attitude toward challenges, framing failure and frustrations as useful parts of the learning process. The teacher also encourages students to set short- and/or long-term goals. This can be observed in the classroom through the following behaviors:

| Score         | 1                                                                                   | 2                                                                                          | 3                                                                                 | 4 | 5 |

# 8.1

The teacher does not acknowledge student efforts. Although the teacher may praise students for “being smart” or “intelligent,” the teacher does not focus on students’ efforts or work. For example: The teacher says, “Very good! You’re the smartest student in the class” or “Well done! You’re so smart!”

The teacher acknowledges students’ efforts rather than focusing only on results, intelligence, or natural abilities. For example: When a student does well on a test, the teacher says, “I know you put so much hard work into this!,” but most times, the teacher praises students by saying they are “smart” or “intelligent.” For example: When students solve a difficult problem they had been struggling with, the teacher praises and highlights the efforts they made to solve the problem. The teacher says, “You have progressed so much on our multiplication problem sets! I’m glad you asked me for help. If you keep practicing and using the strategies we learned in class, you’ll master them all very soon!”

# 8.2

The teacher has a negative attitude toward students’ challenges. For example: The teacher explicitly scolds students for making mistakes or becomes impatient with a student for taking time to understand a new concept.

The teacher has a positive attitude towards students’ challenges. For example: When a student is struggling with a problem set, the teacher says, “Remember, it’s okay to feel frustrated when we’re trying to do something new! Let’s think about how we can go about this.” The teacher also encourages students to think through different resources they could turn to for help (e.g., asking a friend for advice, looking for answers in the textbook).

# 8.3

The teacher does not encourage students to set short- or long-term goals. For example: For short-term goal setting, the teacher says, “How many pages of the book will you read each day this week?” For long-term goal setting, the teacher says, “I want you to write down how much progress you’ve made on the goals we set at the beginning of the school year.”

The teacher encourages students to set short- AND long-term goals. The teacher may reference both long- and short-term goals at the same time, particularly when encouraging students to set a short-term goal that would help them achieve a long-term goal. For example: The teacher says, “Let’s think about the goals we set for ourselves at the beginning of the school year. What is one thing you will do this week that will get you closer to that goal?” Alternatively, the teacher talks about the short- and long-term goals separately (as in the examples for “Medium”). For example: The teacher says, “It’s important to think about what you want to be when you grow up.” In addition, the teacher highlights how characters in a story set a short- or long-term goal for themselves and how they worked toward it.

10 These challenges may include making mistakes, scoring low on a test, or feeling frustrated when trying to understand a concept.

11 Short-term goals are goals that students aim to achieve within a month or less, and long-term goals are goals that span a longer timeframe (e.g., over the school year, when they grow up).

# C.9 SOCIOEMOTIONAL SKILLS

The teacher fosters a collaborative classroom environment.

# SOCIAL & COLLABORATIVE SKILLS

The teacher encourages students’ collaboration with one another and promotes students’ interpersonal skills. Students respond to the teacher’s efforts by collaborating with one another in the classroom, creating an environment free from physical or emotional hostility. This can be observed in the classroom through the following behaviors:

| Score                  | 1                                                                                           | 2                                                                                                  | 3                                                                                         | 4 | 5 |

# 9.1

The teacher promotes students’ collaboration through peer interaction.

The teacher does not promote collaboration among students. For example: The teacher does not provide any opportunities to work in groups or pairs.

The teacher promotes superficial student collaboration through sharing opinions, materials, or ideas. For example: The teacher asks students to read their neighbor’s work or share crayons with each other.

The teacher promotes substantial student collaboration by asking them to work together to produce a product, solve a problem, complete a worksheet, or present a new idea. For example: The teacher asks students to form pairs or groups to complete a task that requires collaboration, such as creating a diagram of the water cycle or coming up with skits to illustrate a set of vocabulary words.

# 9.2

The teacher promotes students’ interpersonal skills, such as perspective taking, empathizing, emotion regulation, and social problem solving.

The teacher does not promote students’ interpersonal skills.

The teacher promotes students’ interpersonal skills in a brief or superficial manner. For example: The teacher tells students to “Help each other” during a group exercise, asks a child to “Say you’re sorry” to a classmate, or encourages children to take turns during an activity. However, the teacher does not explain why these behaviors are important.

The teacher promotes students’ interpersonal skills by encouraging perspective taking, empathizing, emotion regulation, or social problem solving. For example: The teacher asks a student, “How do you think that made him/her (classmate or character in a book) feel?” See FAQ 9.2 for more examples.

# 9.3

Students collaborate with one another through peer interaction.

Students do not collaborate OR when students interact with one another, they display negative behaviors. For example: When asked to pick partners for an activity, students purposefully exclude one or more of their peers.

Students collaborate superficially; there may also be minimal instances where students display negative behaviors (e.g., teasing, pushing, bullying); however, these behaviors are isolated and minor or playful (i.e., no student is upset) and are not a core characteristic of the classroom. For example: Students share materials among themselves in a group, but they complete the activity independently and do not collaborate with one another on problem sets.

Students collaborate with one another by working together to produce a product, solve a problem, complete a worksheet, or present a new idea. There are no displays of negative behavior. For example: Students work in groups to complete a task that requires collaboration, such as creating a diagram of the water cycle or coming up with skits to illustrate a set of vocabulary words.

¹² Perspective taking: The ability to consider a situation from a different point of view. Empathizing: The ability to recognize and share another’s emotions. Emotion regulation: The ability to effectively manage and respond to an emotional experience. Social problem solving: The process that an individual goes through to solve an interpersonal problem. This may involve applying aspects of perspective taking, empathizing, or emotion regulation to a social situation.
